<h3>"PROGRESS OF ASTRONOMY"</h3>

<h3>[<i>From "Whitaker's Almanack" for 1895, under the
heading "Progress of Astronomy."</i>]</h3>

<p>Mr. Langdon, station-master at Silverton, on
the Great Western Railway, a self-taught astronomer,
died on July 18, 1894. Mr. Langdon made
in his spare hours an 8-inch silver-on-glass mirror,
grinding it on a machine of his own construction.
In 1872 he contributed a paper to the <i>Monthly
Notices</i> of the Royal Astronomical Society on
"The Markings of Venus."</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>
THE writing of this foreword to the biography of
the late Mr. Roger Langdon should have devolved
upon one of the notable personages who had an admiration
for him and his work, but unhappily they have all,
or nearly all, passed away. Unquestionably the person
best fitted for the task would have been the late Rev.
H. Fox Strangways, rector of Silverton during the period
when Mr. Langdon acted as station-master there. They
had a very cordial liking and respect for each other, and
Mr. Strangways could doubtless have imparted a personal
and intimate touch to this preface which would have
been very valuable.</p>

<p>When Miss Ellen Langdon desired me to undertake
this portion of the work I felt honoured, though diffident.
A feeling that it was my clear duty to pay any mark of
respect I could to the memory of this worthy man
decided me to accept her invitation.</p>

<p>My acquaintance with Mr. Langdon dates back to a
few years before his death when my father was general
manager of the Great Western Railway and Mr. Langdon
was still at work at Silverton. My father's attention had
been called to the personality and attainments of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Silverton station-master, and as I was at that time
doing a little journalism in odd moments it was suggested
that I should run down and write something for the
<i>Great Western Magazine</i>, which I was very pleased to do.</p>

<p>At that little wayside station just on the London side
of Exeter I therefore found myself one summer afternoon.
The village of Silverton, distant two miles from
the station, was not visible, and the principal features
in the immediate vicinity were the station-master's house,
with the front garden between it and the station, and in
the front garden a circular iron building with a cone-shaped
revolving roof, which, I found, was an observatory
sheltering a telescope for celestial observation.</p>

<p>The tall, slightly stooping, white-bearded old station-master
at once arrested attention. A dignified, patriarchal
type of man, with a kindly, pleasant and simple
manner, he was evidently much averse to all forms of
affectation and cant. I was quickly made welcome and
introduced to his wife and well-ordered home.</p>

<p>We were immediately on excellent terms. I remember
the eager pride with which he showed me his beloved
telescope and its mounting and accessories, including the
sidereal clock, and how I gazed under his direction at the
heavenly objects which the night disclosed. The evening
we spent together was a very memorable one. Mr.
Langdon recounted the hardships and adventures of his
career, and gave me an insight into the manifold difficulties
and obstacles he had overcome in attaining the means
of observing the celestial bodies in which he took so
absorbing an interest. He also displayed for my amusement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
the ingenious church with chimes and other works
of his hands.</p>

<p>It is distinctly to be regretted that his autobiography
ceases before the period when he made his four telescopes.
His own account of his trials and difficulties and of the
indefatigable inventive genius he showed in grappling
with them would have been most instructive. His
achievements become very impressive when his environment
and paucity of means are remembered.</p>

<p>Long hours of duty at a little country station, the
support and clothing of himself, his wife, and eight children
who required to be educated and placed out in the
world&mdash;all accomplished on a weekly wage, which from
his marriage to old age averaged only 30<i>s.</i>, and was in
the earlier years much less&mdash;would have been enough to
exhaust the energy and resources of any ordinary man.
Nevertheless Mr. Langdon found time and means to learn
French, Greek, and Shorthand, to amuse his family and
neighbours with lantern lectures, and to make and use
effectively four telescopes, so that eventually his reputation
spread to the Royal Astronomical Society, before
which he read a paper on his discoveries and observations.
Bear in mind that money was so scarce that he was practically
reduced to make everything, even his tools, with
his own hands from the crude materials, groping his way
through the mists of uncertainty and disappointment
to the haven of ultimate success.</p>

<p>He was fortunate in his marriage, or he would probably
never have succeeded as he did. He always referred to
his wife as an inestimable blessing, and was, by her help,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
as free from home cares as a man with so small an income
and eight children could be. The widow of the late
rector of Silverton bears testimony to the virtues and
many good works of this estimable couple. Their children
rise up and call them blessed. Their character and
example even in this small locality and limited sphere
must have been of very marked value.</p>

<p>The career of Roger Langdon provides for all of us a
striking illustration of what force of character will accomplish
even in the humblest surroundings and in the face
of the most serious obstacles. Such men working persistently
onwards and upwards with such slight recognition
and encouragement are the real heroes of life, and their
memory should be kept green for the benefit of those who
come after them.</p>

</div></div>
<p>I HAVE no distinct recollection of my birth, although
I believe I was a prominent actor in the performance.
The very first thing, or rather, circumstance
that I remember, was the birth of my sister, when I was
two years and five months old. Old Nanny Holland,
who did duty as midwife, nurse and housekeeper, used
to allow me to go out and play with the water and dabble
in the mud; then she would call me in and smack me
well and call me bad names, and shut me under the stairs
until my pinafore was dry. I can quite well remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
crying and asking myself, "Why was I born?" especially
as old Nanny paid greater attention to me in this respect,
than to any of my older brothers. Then, as I grew older,
there was my father who thoroughly believed that the
stick was a cure for all complaints, and acting upon
King Solomon's advice, never spared the rod. On these
occasions, I always asked myself the question, "Why was
I born?"</p>

<p>As soon as old Nanny had gone out of the house, I
asked my mother if it was likely that old Nanny would
bring another baby next week; and when my kind and
loving mother stroked my hair, and smiled and said "No,"
I was very soon out in the lane making bricks and building
houses with mud. My mother did not smack me for
this as old Nanny had done, but she would call me and
speak to me about making myself dirty, and somehow,
whenever she spoke she was always obeyed. She used
to have me by her knee and teach me Dr. Watts's hymns.
I have lived to hear those hymns scoffed at, but I still
think they might do good to some young people. Now at
the age of fifty I take great delight in the study of science
and astronomy. Who shall say that my dear good mother
did not lay the foundation stone, and set my young mind
thinking of the wonderful works of God, by teaching me&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">I sing the almighty power of God<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That made the mountains rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That spread the flowing seas abroad<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And built the lofty skies.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I sing the wisdom that ordained<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The sun to rule the day.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The moon shines full at His command<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And all the stars obey.<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>This hymn, and other precepts taught by my gentle
mother, sank deep into my mind, and set me thinking
and pondering over the works of God, and led me to ask
all sorts of questions, and I might say that I received
all sorts of answers, which made me still more inquisitive,
until my father would tell me to hold my tongue. I do
not wish it to be understood that my father was a wrong-headed
man, far from it; for I am sure that he possessed
some of the finest qualities that adorn human nature.
He possessed, in the very highest degree, the qualities
of truth, justice, honour, and honesty of purpose; he
considered it an exceedingly bad practice to owe anything
to anybody, so he rose very early in the morning and took
rest late that he might maintain his children, in what
he termed "poor independence." Moreover, he being
the parish clerk and Sunday school master&mdash;there was
no week-day school&mdash;he had a very high veneration for
the Church. He was also choir master and organist.
Therefore he was a power in the village, and used his
stick accordingly. Woe to any bellringer who thoughtlessly
entered the door of the church, without removing
his hat from his head. "How dare you," he would say,
"enter the sanctuary of the Lord in that heathenish
manner?" and the men I know very highly respected
him, and obeyed his orders without a murmur. He
would never allow cider, which was the drink of the
country, to be brought inside the church gate; it was
consecrated ground and was not to be defiled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>He was like Job in one thing, he was the father of seven
sons and three daughters.</p>

<p>The state of England at that time was very bad indeed,
and the poor were really oppressed, especially in our remote
part of the country. Well, my father had enough to do
to make both ends meet, and how he and my mother
slaved and toiled to keep out of debt! My brothers
and myself were sent to work at a very early age, at
whatever we could get, and at this period, when the
oppression was so great, I was always asking myself,
"Why was I born?"</p>

<p>In the year 1829, when I was four years of age, my
father and mother had not heard of Dr. Jenner, and his
plan of vaccination. If they had they would have surely
fallen in with the idea, and would have acted upon it.
It was the custom in those days that whenever small-pox
made its appearance in the village, the mother of a
family would take one of her children to the infected
house, and place her healthy child in the bed of the person
who had the malady. This was done so that the infection
should not come upon her family unawares, but that she
might be somewhat in a position to receive it, and with
a little judicious management, generally to keep the
disease under subjection; that is to say, she could generally
manage so that only one of her children should be
down with the small-pox at one time. Whereas, if she
allowed the infection to come upon her in its natural
course, probably all her children would be down at once
with the disease.</p>

<p>Now there was a boy who was said to be dying of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
small-pox, and whether it was ignorance, or superstition,
or a combination of both, I do not know, but it
was considered best, to let your children catch the
small-pox from those who were suffering most violently.
Accordingly I was taken to the house where the boy lay
dying, and there I was partly undressed and placed in
the cradle by the side of the boy, and I was to stay there
until I got warm and comfortable. As far as my own
thoughts went in the matter I thought it very good fun,
especially as when I was ill I should be out of the way of
the stick at any rate. But while I was thinking over
these matters, who should stalk into the room but old
Nanny Holland. Nanny was a sort of oracle in the
village, besides being a kind of quack doctor, and what
with her superior cunning, and evil temper, always
excited more or less with gin, she held most of the poor
women under her thumb, and when she approached the
cradle where we were lying, I thought she looked more
evil than usual. She looked at the cradle, then at the
boy's mother, and said, "Why don't you let the cheil
(<i>child</i>) die? He can't die shut up in an infernal crile
like this." And thereupon she dragged me out, and
put me down, by no means lightly, upon the floor; she
then tore away the foot of the cradle, so that the boy's
feet could extend further down, and he was a corpse
directly.</p>

<p>It appears from Nanny's theory, that although the
child was in the agony of death, and with the last pang
upon him, yet the vital spark could not part from him,
until his crib was lengthened sufficiently to allow his feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
to stretch downward without hindrance. I have sometimes
thought that perhaps old Nanny was more than
half right in her theory.</p>

<p>Now, I cannot tell whether the virus of the boy's
small-pox was too far spent, or whether I was an extraordinarily
healthy subject, or whether perhaps old Nanny
frightened me, but certain it is, I did not catch the small-pox.
Therefore there was but one alternative, and that
was, that I must be inoculated, or, as the villagers expressed,
it "knockle-headed." As soon as I discovered
this I really began to quake with fear, and to wonder
why I was born. Not that I feared the operation
itself, as I had seen it performed on others, but I dreadfully
feared the doctor who would perform upon me. I had
not long to wait before my suspicions and fears were
brought to a climax, for my mother took me off to Nanny
Holland.</p>

<p>Nanny soon began to see about "knockle-heading"
the children, and when she turned to me first, and
I saw her coming towards me, with her surgical knife,
my hair stood on end with fright. Where she obtained
the virus from I do not know, but she clawed hold of my
arm, and stabbed a stocking needle through the skin,
and lifting the skin upwards at the same time with a razor
in her hand, cut a piece, about the size of a threepenny
bit, three parts off, a bit of the skin being left in the way
of a hinge; then with the point of an old knife, she plastered
some matter into the wound, just as you might see
a painter stopping a hole in a board with putty; then
she replaced the slice of skin with the following caution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
"Now, youngster, if you scratch that off, I'll kill thee."
My little sister was put through the same process, and
Louisa Gard, a little chubby happy cherub of about four
years of age, and a constant playmate of ours, was also
operated upon.</p>

<p>In due course old Nanny's "matter" began to work.
My sister was very ill with small-pox, and so also was
little Louisa. As for myself, I had it very slightly, in
fact no one but my mother knew that I had the malady
upon me. My sister got well in time, but of course the
small-pox left its marks severely upon her. Poor little
Louisa never rallied; or if she got over the small-pox,
she had croup, which was too much for her, and she crossed
over into the Land of Beulah.</p>

<p>Louisa and my sister and myself had attended the
Sunday school, for there was no week-day school. I asked
mother if Louisa would come back, and she said "No, but
if you are a good boy, you will someday go where she
is gone." Then I would go out and look up at the stars,
and wonder if I should see Louisa flitting about from
star to star, but my mother said, "No, you will not see
her there, but you will meet her again at the last day;
and if you grow up to be a good man, you will hear the
Great Judge say, 'Come, ye blessed of my Father, and
inherit the Kingdom prepared for you, from the foundation
of the world.'" This and other passages of Scripture
my mother taught me before I was really able to pronounce
the words after her. All this was my religious
instruction, besides what I learnt in the Sunday school.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHILDHOOD'S DAYS</h3>


<p>IN 1834 the curate-in-charge and his sister left our
parish, and moved into Berkshire. Before the
curate left he came to say good-bye to us. He also
brought us some very useful things, which were most
acceptable, for I know my mother had to struggle hard
against wind and tide, as one might say, to keep us six
great rollicking boys tidy, and how she did it as well as
she did, with the scanty materials at her command, I
really cannot conceive; but I do know that she many
times went without food, so that we might have our fill.</p>

<p>The curate looked at my sister's seamed face, then
patted the baby, and said, "Surely, Mrs. Langdon, you
do not want so lovely a child to be disfigured with small-pox,
do you?"</p>

<p>"What can I do to avoid it?" asked my mother.
"We have always been taught by our clergy that all
these evil things are the 'Lord's' will, so who can hinder
it?"</p>

<p>"God's will!" answered the curate. "Have you not
heard what everybody is talking about, I mean vaccination
and cow-pox? Vaccination is a process by which
matter from a cow is inserted into your child's arm, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
in the course of a few days the child will have what is
called cow-pox; it is exceedingly mild, and the child
will not suffer much, and if properly carried out, it is a
sure preventive of small-pox."</p>

<p>"Dear, me," said my mother, "I wish I had known
this sooner. I would gladly have had all my children
vaccinated."</p>

<p>"I am very glad to hear you say so," replied the curate,
"but it was only accidentally that I mentioned it to you.
I have spoken to several people about it, and I have
found them so thoroughly prejudiced on the subject that
I have found it prudent to hold my tongue. Go to
Martock to Dr. Stuckey, and I know he will vaccinate
the baby free of charge, and as I am leaving the village
to-morrow I am very sorry that I shall not be able to
know the result of the operation."</p>

<p>My father had in the meantime come home to dinner,
and had heard the latter part of the conversation, and
he said, "I will take care you know the result, sir. When
it is all over I will write and send you a letter, and let
you know all about it, and my wife and myself are truly
grateful to you for mentioning it."</p>

<p>I have only to add that my father did write the letter
to tell the good parson all about the baby having been
vaccinated, and he had to pay one shilling and tenpence
for that letter to be posted, besides having to walk
several miles to the office.</p>

<p>Here I must say a few words in reference to Nanny
Holland, and how it was that such an old shrew should
be able to hold such power over nearly all the housewives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
of the village. In her younger days Nanny had
the reputation of being exceedingly skilful in midwifery.
Moreover Nanny had been known more than once to
set a broken leg, or arm, when the doctor was too busy,
or, which was often the case, too drunk to attend. Nanny
was always ready to assist her neighbours in cases of
sickness. She would go when called upon, whether by
night or by day; and if any one hesitated to call her, she
would not be any the better pleased, and would give
them what she called a bit of the rough side of her tongue.</p>

<p>But there was still another reason, and not an unimportant
one, why the women in the village did not always
consider it prudent to offend old Nanny. At that time
almost, if not quite, every wife in the village made her
own bread, and Nanny had the only oven in the parish;
and there the women would go, carrying their dough
with them, to be made into loaves and baked.</p>

<p>In those days there was no electric telegraph, but
somehow or other news would fly; and my baby sister
had not been vaccinated many hours before the news
reached old Nanny's ears, and she took the first opportunity
to call and find out particulars, so she came in
with her teeth clenched, and her dark eyes sparkling with
rage, and said, "I have just heard some news, and what
dost thee think 'tis? Why, I heard that thee's been
down to thicky doctor and had thy chiel knockle-headed
with vaccination."</p>

<p>"Well, so I have," replied my mother, "and I am only
sorry that I did not know of vaccination sooner, so that
I could have had all my children vaccinated."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Whew," said Nanny, "of all natural fools I ever
knowed, thee art the cussedest fool of all. Mind'ee, if
thee brings thy dough to my bakehouse Vriday next,
I'll kick thee and thy dough out vaster than thee brought it
in." And without another word old Nanny went away, and
from that day forward she always gave my mother a
wide berth. Whenever they met she would cross the
road and pass along on the other side.</p>

<p>I have stated that our curate-in-charge had left the
village and gone into Berkshire. The rector was a
gentleman whom I had never seen. It was reported that
he was squandering his time and his health and wealth
on the turf, amongst thieves, black-legs, thimble-riggers,
and other rogues and vagabonds. I know that it is not
always prudent to believe all that is stated by the tongues
of the villagers, but in this case I fear the accusation
was only too true; in fact, the probabilities were that
in this case the village gossip did not know all the truth.
One thing was certain, he had to go about incognito
as the bailiffs of the county court were constantly looking
after him to serve him with a writ, or to arrest his person.
Only one good thing do I know of him; he used to send
four pounds a year to my father for the maintenance
of the Sunday school.</p>

<p>After our curate left, it was several months before
we had another. The parsons of the neighbouring
villages used to come, and sometimes we had morning
service, and sometimes afternoon, and sometimes evening
service, and more often no service at all. I remember
on one occasion the bells were chimed at half-past ten,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
and the people came to church, but no parson came;
the project again was tried at three, and again the people
came, and again no parson, and as a sort of forlorn hope
the bells were chimed again at six, and still no parson
came.</p>

<p>Old George Pant and a few others set up services about
this time in the blacksmith's shop. Now old George
Pant wore a wig, and other boys and myself used to go
and peep through a large crack in the door of the blacksmith's
shop, and watch him while he was praying. He
used to get dreadfully excited and shake himself about,
till by and by his wig would drop down behind him.</p>

<p>I had seen George Pant shake off his wig more than
once, and the wicked thought entered my mind to try and
steal that wig, which piece of theft I actually did accomplish
on the very next Sunday evening; and this is the
way I did it. The door of the blacksmith's shop in which
the meetings were held had in it several large cracks which
I could easily put my hand through; and I noticed
that when George was praying, he, and all his congregation,
knelt with their backs towards the door; and so
intent were they upon their devotions, that one could
open the door and go in and out again, without attracting
their attention. But I was too prudent to risk myself in
far enough to pick up the coveted wig, when it should
chance to fall; so I provided myself with a long stick, and
tied a couple of eel-hooks to one end, and watched my
opportunity through the crack in the door. I had not
very long to wait. George began to pray, and presently
down came the wig. Directly it touched the ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
my fish-hook caught it up, and in another instant I was
out of sight of the door with the wig under my arm. But
I was no sooner at a safe distance, than I began to reflect,
and I would have given the world to restore the wig to its
place, but I knew I dared not do it. I knew that if I
gave it up to its owner, he would freely forgive me, but
my father would literally skin me. So I dug a hole in our
orchard at the foot of the quince tree, dropped the wig
in, and simply held my tongue. Its sudden disappearance
was a nine days' mystery in the village.</p>

<p>Meanwhile my father and mother were doing their
level best to keep the Sunday school going with no help
from any one; and there we children were taught the
catechism, and lessons from the Old and New Testaments;
and the stick was frequently used. At length we received
news that a new parson was coming, and all sorts of
speculations were rife as to what sort of parson he would
be. Was he young or old? Married or single? Rich
or poor? At last the bells were set ringing, and every
boy blew his penny whistle and fired his pop-gun, because
the Reverend Peter Manonni Scrope Cornwall, M.A.,
with his two sons, and two daughters, and sister-in-law,
Miss Brown, who was his housekeeper, had actually
arrived. Mr. Cornwall took the curacy at £80 per year,
and an old tumbledown, damp, dismal den of a house
to live in. Now the Rev. P. M. S. Cornwall had to
preach the Gospel and educate his four children, keep up
the dignity of his profession, visit and succour the sick,
give to missionaries, buy books for the Sunday school,
and subscribe to the thirty-nine articles, besides giving an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
annual treat to one hundred children, all out of £80 per
annum. All of which he did to perfection.</p>

<p>Mr. Cornwall was what may be called a good-natured,
good-tempered sort of man; somewhat inclined to be
stout; and I know that if any one was troubled in mind,
body, or estate, they had only to go and open their
heart to Mr. Cornwall and they would be sure to find a
friend. Moreover he had such a pleasant, benevolent-looking
face that those who saw him were bound to love
him. His sister-in-law, Miss Brown, was a lady of
independent means, and when people went to their
pastor to complain Miss Brown would almost surely
be present, and she would put in a word here and there,
as the case might require. She would blow people up if
she discovered that their grief was brought about by
their own naughtiness, as she would term it. She would
tell them that they must be born again, and that they
must go regularly to church, and after she had told them
of their faults and how to mend them, she would dip her
hand down into the recesses of her great wallet and
bring up half-a-crown, and hand it over to the grieved one
and say, "Bless your heart, you must give God the glory,
you must pray all day long, bless your heart, and say,
'Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right
spirit within me,' and then you won't fall into trouble
again, bless your heart."</p>

<p>The very first Sunday she was in the village she went
and took full possession of the Sunday school, and asked
my father to give her the names of all the people who
had children but did not send them to school, saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
she would go round and ask the fathers and mothers
to send their children. So during the week Miss Brown
trudged from house to house, and asked the parents why
the children were not sent to school. Most of them
began to make excuses. Some had no clothes fit to go in,
some had no shoes, some were sick with influenza, some
were getting well, and others getting ill with small-pox;
in fact, some had real excuses, and some made paltry
excuses. But Miss Brown was equal to the occasion.
Those who were ill were to come to the parsonage for
medicine, others were to come for clothes, shoes, or
hats. Anything and everything could be had for the
fetching of it, and it was really astonishing how Miss
Brown came by garments to suit nearly every child in
the village; if she had been a marine store dealer, she
could not have been possessed of more odds and ends, so
that fathers and mothers as well as their children had
not a shadow of an excuse for not coming to church or
school.</p>

<p>But the funniest thing was that Miss Brown did not let
old George Pant escape her notice. She called upon
him, and his wife began to make excuse for him, that
he had no hair on his head, and that he used to wear a
wig, but some mischievous person had stolen it, and
that George could not go to church and sit in a draught
or he would catch such a cold that he would not get
well again for months. Miss Brown listened as patiently
as she could, and then said, "Bless your heart, I have
a wig that was my uncle's; and if George Pant will
come or send to the parsonage he shall be most welcome to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
it. It will just suit his complexion, bless your heart, and
if people will only pray to the Lord, He will always give
them what is good for them, bless your heart. You
must 'seek the Lord while He may be found, and call
upon Him while He is near.'"</p>

<p>The Sunday school was held in the church, there being
no school-house in the parish, and every Sunday, in all
weathers, at nine in the morning and half-past two in
the afternoon, Miss Brown would be at the church door
waiting to go in and open school; and I do believe that
Miss Brown's great gold watch was always half an hour too
fast, for my father, who was the very cream of punctuality,
could not keep time with her. Father kept the keys,
and he was not always ready to open the church doors
when the time was up by Miss Brown's great gold watch,
and when he did arrive she would give him a gentle
reminder that he was not in time by pulling out of her
great wallet that great gold watch, and saying as she did
so, "Come, come, children, in to school; we are already
two minutes late, and we have no time to lose; come and
read." All had to read or learn a text, and were taught
the catechism, before the afternoon service, which began
at three o'clock. But Miss Brown was very tender-hearted
towards her brother-in-law, the curate, and if
that gentleman happened to have a cold, or a touch of
the gout, which happened very often, then somehow
there were fifty or fifty-five minutes between half-past
two and three o'clock by Miss Brown's great gold watch,
because "bless your heart, Mr. Cornwall has a bad cold
and cannot walk very fast."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>Also Mr. Cornwall came amongst us most Sunday
evenings and gave us some wholesome admonition, and
he would tell us of all the most interesting things that
were going on in the outer world, and of which we
should never have heard without him. And when the
dear man stood there in our midst telling us all these
stories, his face beaming with goodness and kindness, and
his hair as white as snow, I think I almost worshipped
him. Then about every sixth or seventh Sunday he
would preach a sermon specially to the young. Thus
did the Rev. P. M. Cornwall and Miss Brown take possession
of the hearts of the people, both old and young, and
in a very few years boys and girls grew up, and, as young
men and maidens, still attended the Sunday school&mdash;a
school that could not be matched for miles around.
On Easter Monday Mr. Cornwall would invite us to meet
him in the churchyard, and we would join hands and
encircle the church. Then he would feed us with hot
cross buns, and do all in his power, with the help of Miss
Brown, to make us happy. It seems needless to record how
much these two good people were beloved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>STARTING IN LIFE</h3>


<p>AT the tender age of eight I was sent to work on a
farm belonging to Joseph Greenham. For the
princely sum of one shilling a week I had to mind sheep
and pull up turnips in all winds and weathers, starting at
six o'clock in the morning. Very often I was out in the
pouring rain all day and would go home very wet, and
then my good mother had something to do to dry, not only
my wet clothes, but also those of my four brothers.
And I know it took her half the night to mend and tidy
all our clothes. As soon as I was able I had to go driving
plough, for in those days a man would not think of ploughing
without a boy to drive the horses. Now it was my sad
fate to be placed under the hands of the most complete
vagabond that it was possible for the spirit of all evil to
beget. I cannot here tell&mdash;and if I could, nobody would
credit&mdash;the dreadful usage which I received from his
hands.</p>

<p>Although Mr. Greenham was my employer, yet to all
intents and purposes Jim the ploughman was my master.
I was completely in his hands and under his control, and
it was in his power to do what he thought fit. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
was a public-house in our village kept by a widow,
whose name, curiously enough, was Temperance Patch.
Jim was one of the best customers that Temperance
Patch had. He spent all the money he could earn, beg
or steal, in her house, and when he had no cash, he did not
scruple to steal his employer's hay, corn, straw, eggs,
fowls and potatoes; in fact everything portable was
carried away to the <i>New Inn</i>. I once thought it my duty
to report to Mr. Greenham that Jim had carried away a
large bundle of hay, and when Mr. Greenham taxed him
with theft, he cursed and swore, and said that I was a
wicked young liar. After this, until I was thirteen years
of age, my life was not worth the living; for I was
thrashed and kicked and beaten most unmercifully by
this brute. So I learned that a still tongue makes a wise
head, and never once again did I say anything to any one,
not even my mother, about the cruel treatment which
it was my lot to receive. Jim used to make me harness
the horses long before I was tall enough to reach their
heads, and beat and kick me if I could not do it quickly
enough for his liking; and I used to wonder every day
and all day, and ask myself, "Why was I born?" Sometimes
Jim would lie down under the hedge and go to sleep,
making me plough the ground the while; and although
I was but a child and scarcely tall enough to reach the
plough handles, yet if he woke up and found any bad
ploughing he would beat me to his heart's content. But
with it all, he never could get me to tell the abominable
lies that he would put in my mouth to tell Mr. Greenham
so as to save him a scolding when he had been neglecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
his work. I had learnt from Mr. Cornwall and also from
my father that lying lips are an abomination to the Lord,
and this feeling was so strong within me that I could
never corrupt my conscience and degrade myself to repeat
Jim's falsehoods, and I came in for many castigations
accordingly.</p>

<p>On one occasion Mr. Greenham took Jim and me to
the cellar, to lime some wheat before it was sown. While
we were there Mr. Greenham was called away, and directly
his back was turned Jim caught up a dipper, as if he had
not another moment to live, drew some cider and
drank it greedily down; then he drew some more and
offered it to me, but I refused. With an oath he pressed
the edge of the dipper against my lips until they bled
with the pressure; at the same time he held me by my
hair, in order as he thought to pour the stolen liquid down
my throat; but Jim did not succeed in his purpose, so he
drank it himself and threatened, using fearful imprecations,
that if I ever said a word about it he would kill me
on the spot. I don't think I should ever have said anything
about it, but thieves are generally great fools. Jim
in his greedy haste did not turn the tap back as it was
before, so that there were a few drops on the pavements.
The dipper, also, was wet and smelled of cider. So Mr.
Greenham accused him, but Jim began to call God to
witness that he was as innocent as a dove, and he had the
impudence to refer to me to prove his honesty. The
master asked me and I told him the simple truth, knowing
full well that I should catch it soon. As soon as Jim's
guilt was discovered beyond dispute, he began to shed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
crocodile tears, and to lament and beg pardon in such a
humble and seemingly contrite manner that the master's
eyes were blinded, and he forgave him there and then.</p>

<p>The next day we went into a field to plough, and now
my punishment began. Jim belaboured me with the
horsewhip as long as he felt disposed. He knocked me
down and tried to jerk the breath out of my body. Then
he wrenched my mouth open with a large nail and filled
it with dirt. He allowed me to get on my legs again
and resume ploughing for a time, but he soon began on
me again. He struck me down and kicked me, and danced
upon me, till I felt very faint and ill with loss of blood.
I really thought my end had come, and I felt very glad.
It may seem rather paradoxical, but that moment was
the happiest moment of my life. I thought of dear Miss
Brown, and her teachings: "Blessed are they that mourn,
for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the pure in heart,
for they shall see God. Blessed are they which are persecuted
for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom
of Heaven." All these and other precepts flashed into my
mind, for I knew it was out of envy that I was so cruelly
used. But somehow I refused to die at his bidding, so
Jim waited for another time to try and send me out of the
world as if by accident.</p>

<p>One of the horses was exceedingly ticklish when
touched in a certain way upon its backbone, and could
not bear to be touched on this particular spot with a curry
comb, and sometimes when so irritated would let fly with
both heels at once. So on the morning following the last
punishment Jim set me to clean some portion of the harness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
and made me stand in a certain position directly
behind the ticklish horse. There I worked away without
any idea that mischief was brewing. Jim, however, had
laid all his plans, and if they had succeeded and I had been
killed, he would have been found blameless. There was
an open window to the stable exactly opposite and close
to the ticklish horse, so that a man outside, by standing
on a ledge of the wall, could put his hand through and
touch the horse's back. I heard the horse make a noise,
and on looking up saw Jim's head outside the window,
and his hand upon the horse's back. At the same moment
the horse let fly, and one of his heels came against
my left side and sent me dashing against the wall. I
knew no more until I found myself in bed with my mother
crying and washing the blood from my hair and face, and
felt a great pain in my hip, where the horse's hoof struck.
There was also a big scar on my head where I was knocked
against the wall. I can only account for not having been
finished off that time by the fact that the horse did not
kick when it was first touched, but began to prance about,
which arrested my attention and I moved close to his
heels. If I had been a little further off his heels would
have struck my head or the upper part of my body and I
should not have been here to write.</p>

<p>After lying in bed about a week, where I cogitated and
wondered for what earthly purpose I was born, I had to
go back under this fiend again. Every other place in
the parish was filled and my parents could not afford to
keep me in idleness, so there was nothing for it, but to go
back to work again as soon as possible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>A few days after this the very same horse got restive
in a field where we were and turned over a cartload of
manure upon poor Jim. I thought he was killed, in
fact for a moment I hoped he was killed. But immediately
I would have given worlds to have called back the
thought. Miss Brown's words came upon me, quick as
a lightning flash, "Create in me a clean heart, O God,
and renew a right spirit within me." Other of her precepts
came strongly into my mind, and I shook with fear,
for I had learned that to wish a man dead amounted to
the same thing as killing him. Therefore, I felt that I
had committed a most grievous sin, and I cannot express
the joy I felt when I saw Jim crawl out from under the
cart unhurt. He began to curse and swear at the horse
and me, saying it was all my fault, whereas it was his
own fault, as in harnessing the horse he had negligently
left the buckle of a strap under the cartsaddle, so that the
buckle rested exactly upon the backbone of the horse and
caused him to be restive.</p>

<p>I was under Jim's control for five years&mdash;years of my
childhood, which I ought to be able to say were the
happiest of my life. But they were just the reverse, and
if I stated all that I suffered at his hands, no sane person
would believe that such things could have been done with
impunity.</p>

<p>Not many years ago Mrs. Beecher Stowe shocked the
refined feelings of the civilized world with her graphic
account of the sufferings of the negro slaves in the United
States of America. I cannot write my history in the shape
and manner of a novel, with its parts and counter-parts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
but what I have written are some of the main facts and
features of my boyhood life. Some people, those who
have passed smoothly through their childhood, and have
scarcely known sorrow, may ask whether it is possible
that such things could have been done in England? My
answer to this is, yes. It was not the parents, but the
age that was to blame, as may be learnt from some of the
works of Charles Dickens, and other writers who have
given pictures of the period. I know that my brothers
could write a parallel history, and they were not under
the hands of so complete a blackguard as it fell to my lot
to be under.</p>

<p>When the season for ploughing was over I used to get
a few weeks' relief from the hands of my tormentor.
During such times I was sent into the fields minding sheep.
These were days of pleasure and happiness. I had to work
hard, but toil was a pleasure as long as I had no one to
abuse and ill-use me. I was the happy possessor of a
tattered Testament, and I used to read from its torn pages.
It began at the words, "Let not your heart be troubled,"
and ended with the twenty-seventh chapter of the
Acts. I read the first and last chapters more than all the
rest, and really knew them all, every word.</p>

<p>Now dear old Mr. Cornwall used to come out in the
fields and find me out and ask me questions about Scripture
history, and I believe I used to answer him to his
satisfaction for he called me a good boy. As far as I
know it was the first time I had been called a good boy
except by my mother, and I fancy I grew an inch taller
all at once and that his calling me a good boy had a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
strong influence in making me try to be good; but whenever
he talked to me my conscience pricked me relative
to old George Pant's wig. I never could forgive myself
for stealing it, and would have confessed to Mr. Cornwall
concerning it, but I thought he would tell my father, and
I did not want an extra thrashing.</p>

<p>I used to leave work at six o'clock, and Mr. Cornwall
told me that if I would come to the parsonage and pull
up the weeds in his garden path he would give me a shilling.
The idea of having a whole shilling, all in a lump,
frightened me. I had never possessed a coin of the realm
above the value of a halfpenny, and such halfpennies
were, like angels' visits, few and far between, for the wages
which I earned had to go for my maintainance. So I
went every evening to accomplish the work, and was very
particular to do it well, so that nothing should prevent the
free and unconditional receipt of the shilling. I had
been to Crewkerne a few weeks previously and had seen
a book in the printseller's window; it was <i>Pinnock's
Catechism on Astronomy</i>. My heart had been aching to
obtain that book, but the price was ninepence, and I
knew that if I saved up those very scarce halfpennies it
would be years before I got ninepence, and so I thought I
should never get the book. But now a new light had
unexpectedly fallen upon the subject. My dream of
possessing "Pinnock" would now be realized, and that
much sooner than I ever had imagined. I should now be
able to run over to Crewkerne and buy the book and have
threepence change. Therefore I finished my task, and
swept and cleaned up all the weeds, and with a joyous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
heart I presented myself at the parsonage door for my
promised shilling. "Put not thy trust in Princes" is
a trite saying, but oh, how deeply and grievously I
realized its truth, for I never received that shilling.
Mr. Cornwall was laid up with a fit of gout, and what with
the twinges of the malady and the business of his curacy,
I suppose he had forgotten me.</p>

<p>When Mr. Cornwall was upon his feet again I was too
shy to ask him for the shilling and so it was passed by,
and I was compelled to go without the pleasure of reading
"Pinnock" for several years. About two years after this
Mr. Cornwall came out to see me in the fields. I had
gone to another field a mile away, but had left my jacket
and some tools and my fragment of a Testament, all rolled
up together in a corner of the hedge which I had been
in the habit of using as a dining-room. So the parson
thought he would be inquisitive. He opened my jacket
and found an assortment of things that I had cut out of
sticks and turnips. There were ships, soldiers, sailors,
anything and everything, and I afterwards heard him
tell father that he had fairly roared with laughter on finding
them.</p>

<p>A few days after this I saw the dear old face coming up
the side of the hill where I was with the sheep. He was
approaching very slowly; he never could walk very fast
across the fields, because Miss Brown always would
insist on his wearing a pair of her old clogs that he
shouldn't catch cold, "bless your heart." When he came up
to me he began to ask me questions and whether I found
time to read the Bible. So by degrees he got me to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
him my fragment of a Testament. He turned over the
leaves and returned it to me. Then he pulled out from
his pocket a brand new Bible. It was a reference
Bible, such a book as could not be bought at that time for
less than seven or eight shillings. Mr. Cornwall gave it
to me and told me to read, mark, learn, etc. In the fly
leaf he had written:&mdash;"Presented to Roger Langdon,
for his good conduct at the Sunday school, by the Rev.
P. M. S. Cornwall."</p>

<p>I cannot describe my feelings on that occasion. I believe
I laughed and cried. I kept that Bible, and carried
it about with me wherever I went; until, a few days before
I was married, it was stolen from my lodgings in Bristol.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<h3>MY SECRET DEPARTURE</h3>


<p>SINCE Jim had compelled me to plough the ground
while he slept, or otherwise idled his time, by the
time I was twelve years of age I could plough a straight
furrow. It was considered a crime of the deepest dye
to plough a crooked one. There was a ploughing match
to come off at Haselbury, and Mr. Greenham entered
me on the list as a first-class boy, and Jim was entered
as a first-class man; we then had to practise side by
side in a field of clover. Everybody said I should win
the head prize, which for the boys was £3, while the
head prize for men was £5 with a society's coat and
buttons. At length the important day arrived, and
everybody went to the field where a piece of land or
ridge must be ploughed in fourteen rounds; that is to
say, the plough must go across the field and back again
fourteen times, which makes twenty-eight furrows for
each piece of land. Neither more nor less must be
ploughed in these twenty-eight furrows. All the furrows
must be straight, no grass or weeds must be seen
sticking up between them, and when finished the ridge
must be level and even. Now there was one ridge which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
had a hollow across it in a diagonal direction, and as all
the pieces of land to be ploughed were drawn for by
lot, this piece came to my share.</p>

<p>I asked the umpires if they expected me to get that
hollow up level, and they said Yes, most decidedly;
but they would give me an extra half hour to do it in.
So at it we went, whistling the tune of "God speed the
plough and the Devil take the farmer." Now, notwithstanding
the hollows, I had the pleasure of hearing my
work praised exceedingly, which gave me much courage.
I finished my piece as soon as the rest had finished theirs.
We then had the pleasure, the inestimable pleasure, of
seeing the farmers and gentry eating roast reef and plum
pudding in a decorated barn. The smell of these good
things ought to have done us good. For myself I was
very hungry, having had nothing to eat since before six
o'clock in the morning. When they had dined we were
called in one by one to receive our rewards. I heard
my name called, and went into the barn to receive my
prize. The squire, who was the spokesman, praised my
work and said that I should make an excellent ploughman,
and had it not been for the hollow, which I had
not fetched up to their satisfaction, I should have been
entitled to the first prize. But as it was I should be
awarded the third prize of £1.</p>

<p>Now Jim got nothing. I do not know why, for he
was undoubtedly a good ploughman when he chose to
put himself into his work. So he sent me home with
the horses, as it was getting late, and said he would go
and get my £1. I had no choice but to obey his orders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and I never saw my money, for he went straightway to
Temperance Patch's, and spent it there. My poor mother
went to him about it, but she received nothing but
curses.</p>

<p>So now I began seriously to think how I could get out
of his power. I used to measure myself once a week to
see how soon I should be tall enough for the Army. I
was thirteen years of age, and big and strong. So when
Her Majesty Queen Victoria was crowned I went to
Yeovil, and for the first time in my life saw and heard a
military band. I asked them to take me, as I could play
a flute or cornet, but they replied, "You must grow a
bit, and then call on us again."</p>

<p>I grew a good deal during the next year, when I was
fourteen. I was determined to bear Jim's cruelty no
longer, and I knew I was now tall enough for the Army.
So I made preparations for a start. I was receiving four
shillings and sixpence a week, which was good wages at
that time; but of course this all went for my maintenance.
I went to my master, however, and asked him to keep my
wages for three or four weeks, so that I might take it all
in a lump, but I shrewdly held my tongue as to why.
It was the only occasion on which I did not act quite
openly with my mother, but in my mind I knew I should
make it up to her later. So when my wages amounted
to nearly £1, I asked Mr. Greenham for it and then
made a start. I put together what few clothes I had and got
up at three o'clock in the morning, with mixed feelings
of joy and sorrow secretly bidding adieu to mother,
father, brothers and sisters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>On arriving at the end of the village I glanced back
to take a last look at the church and steeple, which were
just discernible in the grey dawn. I thought of Mr. Cornwall,
and Miss Brown, some of whose teaching again
came into my mind. I remembered that I had so often
repeated the words, "The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall
not want," and "I will lay me down in peace and take
my rest, for it is Thou, O Lord, that makest me to dwell
in safety." I now began to make tracks for Weymouth,
thirty-three miles distant, and beyond the first seven miles
I did not know an inch of the way.</p>

<p>I trudged on, however, like a snail, carrying all I possessed
on my back. After about nine or ten hours'
sharp walking I arrived at the quaint old town of Dorchester,
where I walked leisurely through the streets,
looking at the old-fashioned houses, and such things as
took my attention. Just as I was going to turn into a
shop to get some bread and cheese, a smart recruiting
sergeant came striding up the street towards me. He
clapped his hand upon my shoulder and said, "Here,
young man, will you enlist?" I do not know whether the
perversity I showed is a characteristic of human nature,
or whether it belonged to me individually, but if he had
asked me to take a dose of poison, I could not have felt
more vexed and annoyed; and when he showed me the
shilling, the disgust I felt was beyond description. Perhaps
the fact of my being very hungry had something
to do with it, but at any rate the idea of being a soldier
went entirely out of my head for ever.</p>

<p>After an hour's rest in Dorchester, I travelled forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
I still had about eight miles to go, and my feet were
already blistered. I scarcely felt it, however, as I had
often had them blistered when ploughing, with Jim's
ill-usage into the bargain; but now I had freed myself
for ever from his cruelty, and I went along with a light
heart.</p>

<p>I reached Weymouth about five o'clock in the afternoon.
I had done the thirty-three miles, including
stoppages, in fourteen hours. I walked round the harbour
and asked every skipper I could find if he would
take me on board his vessel in any capacity, but from all
came the same answer, "No." So I began to think
that the world and its inhabitants were not exactly what I
had always thought or fancied they were. All the sea-songs
I had heard, "The poor Sailor Boy," "The Cabin Boy,"
and others, had led me to believe that the skippers of
vessels were only too glad to get hold of a boy when the
chance offered; but now I found out my mistake. But
one man told me that a shipowner in Jersey was in want
of hands. I made inquiries and soon found out that a
steamer would start for Jersey at nine o'clock the same
evening.</p>

<p>I went on board, paid ten shillings for my passage,
and was soon off towards Jersey.</p>

<p>I cannot describe how much I enjoyed the view of
the sea, especially when we began to lose sight of Portland.
The moon was shining and I could look around and see
a great expanse of water. The sea was not rough, although
there was a swell which was sufficient to toss the vessel
up and down in what I soon found to be a very disagreeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
manner. I soon began in right earnest to feel what the
French call "mal de mer."</p>

<p>After a twelve-hours' passage, which was considered
good work at that time, we landed in Jersey. I at once
found my way to the shipowner, and he set me to work there
and then unloading salt from a ship at one shilling and
sixpence a day. The salt was not in lumps, but in the
form of small grain. It was at that time used in England
for manure; but in Jersey and France it was used for
salting butter, meat and fish. To any whose shoes have
been worn off their feet, and their feet blistered and
made sore with walking, I need hardly say that the salt
soon found its way into my boots and made me nearly
faint with pain. However, it was soon over, and in a
couple of days I believe my feet were hard enough to
walk upon flints without any inconvenience.</p>

<p>Sunday soon came round, and I brushed myself up and
went to St. James' Church. As I glanced over my person
I found that my only suit was very much the worse for
wear after unloading, but I had no idea of staying away
from church on this account. In the afternoon I went
to the town church and saw the soldiers walk down
from Fort Regent, with their fife and drum band playing
"The girl I left behind me" right down to the church
door. As soon as they were out again the band struck up
"The Irish Washerwoman." I thought it was very
wicked, and wondered what my father would have said
about it. On the Monday morning, the judge of the island,
who was my employer, came into the stores, where I was
at work, racking brandy, and adding water and logwood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
and a drug, the name of which I do not remember, by
which means we made three hogsheads out of two. Now
the judge was one of the richest merchants in the island,
and therefore thought it his duty to set a good example to
the other merchants, and to all seafaring men. He was
a large importer of wine, rum, brandy, and gin, and was
always very particular to see that we did not put too
much water and logwood into the brandy, and water
and sulphuric acid into the gin. So that his spirits were
always considered the best in the island. The judge
went regularly to church, and as he was walking round
the stores on this particular Monday morning he came
up to me and said, "Young man, I was much pleased
to see you at church yesterday. Are those the only
clothes you have?" I confess that these remarks about
my clothes did not please me, because on the Sunday I
had gone to church feeling unhappy at not being able
to change my garments, and hoped that no one would
notice me; and when I found that the judge had noticed
me, I must say I felt seriously annoyed. I answered him
civilly, however, that it was my only suit, but that I
should get a new one at the first opportunity. The judge
raised my wages there and then to two <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'shilings'">shillings</ins> a day,
and in the afternoon called me into his private office
and told me to go to his house as his wife would like to
see me.</p>

<p>During the rest of the day I was nearly beside myself,
wondering what on earth such a great lady could want with
a poor boy like me; therefore I was twisting and turning
the thing over in my mind, wondering whether she could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
speak English, and what she would say to me and how
I should answer her. At length evening came, and I
went to the house and was presented to her. She was
exceedingly plain in her dress, as all Jersey ladies were,
and I could scarcely believe it was the wife of the judge.
However, she soon told me what she wanted me for. She
said, "J'ai some clothes for de garçon; de coat was too
much big, go to de tailor and have one gros cossack too
make little from fit for yourself. Reste vous one little
minute, je donne vous some-sing for to mange." The
drift of all this was that she gave me a meal and a
left-off suit of the judge's. He was one of the largest
men in the island. I was a mere stripling, and I believe
I could have stood in one of the legs of the trousers.
I could not get a tailor to do anything with such a suit
unless I paid him more than a new suit of clothes, and I
did not go to church for several Sundays, until I had
saved enough to buy myself a decent suit.</p>

<p>Now the judge was known to be a very pious man.
He would take hold of little dirty urchins in the street
when he heard them using bad language and reprimand
them. His own people had to pull a long face and assume
a virtue if they had it not. And when the postman
came round with a petition to get off his Sunday duty,
everybody in the district signed it except the judge.
He could not forego the pleasure of receiving and reading
a few letters and allow the poor postman to go free on
a Sunday. I have been greatly amused more than once
on going into an Assize Hall and seeing the judge sitting
in his chair, looking as grave and solemn as only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
judge can look. The clerk of the court read the Queen's
proclamation against vice and immorality; solemnly
called upon the magistrates and sheriffs of counties to use
all their power to suppress all kinds of vice and lewdness,
especially Sabbath breaking; and yet the judge could
not allow the double rap at his door to cease on a
Sunday.</p>

<p>I got on capitally with this lady; we seemed to understand
each other at first sight. But do what I would, I
could not bring myself to feel the respect due to her,
simply because she wore a pair of old and dirty wooden
shoes, a short, rough woollen skirt, a great red-patterned
kerchief over her shoulders, and a large, stiff, white muslin
cap on her head. Altogether she cut such a figure,
that I could not fancy she was the wife of a rich merchant
and judge. But I found after a while that the ladies
of Jersey were exceedingly plain and unassuming. They
assisted in house and dairy work; they milked and fed
the cows. It was a very common thing to see the farmers'
wives and daughters milk cows into one can, and goats
into another; then, tying the cans together and slinging
them across an old horse's back, they would perch themselves
on the top, and set off to town at five o'clock in
the morning, to sell the milk from door to door. They
returned to breakfast and spent the remainder of the day
working in the fields. I saw them, both in Jersey and
in France, actually ploughing, sowing, reaping and
mowing; and yet these people were rich and had their
thousands in the bank. After witnessing how hard
the women had to work in Jersey and France, I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
not surprised that Napoleon I. said that England was a
paradise for women.</p>

<p>I continued in the employ of the judge all the summer.
My usual work was to adulterate the wine, brandy, gin,
rum, and whisky; and though constantly amongst
this firewater, I am thankful to say I did not acquire
the taste for any of it. Yet all who worked there could
have what they liked. The judge gave carte blanche.
I often thought what a paradise this would have been
for Jim, how he would have made himself a perfect
walking swill-tub; but it would have soon killed him.
I watched many strong sturdy fellows from Devon and
Cornwall actually kill themselves with the accursed
stuff. Not that they were drunkards; nothing of the
sort. But because brandy could be purchased at sixpence
a bottle, so they would constantly be sipping it. They
did not get drunk, but would take a little in winter to
keep the cold out, and a little more in summer to keep out
the heat; they would soon get "brain fever," or as some
people would say, sunstroke, and die ramping mad. I
have seen and known this in many cases both of men and
women.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>LIFE IN JERSEY</h3>


<p>THE judge had a fleet of ships of his own trading to
nearly every corner of the globe, and in the months
of September and October several vessels returned from
the Newfoundland fishery, laden with codfish, whalebone,
sperm oil, and seal, beaver, fox, and other skins. He made
me a sort of deputy-clerk, and I had to note down every
article with its number and weight. This I did so much
to his satisfaction that at Christmas he actually gave me
a sovereign as a present over and above my wages; and
a few kind and complimentary words that he spoke
made me feel as if I had suddenly grown an inch taller.
Now I began to feel very pleased and glad I was born.</p>

<p>I began to think myself surpassingly rich, for I had
three good suits of clothes, and six golden sovereigns in my
pocket, and I thought of poor Jim the ploughman, who
used to go to bed early on Saturday night to give his
mother the opportunity to wash his one and only ragged
shirt, so that he might have it clean on Sunday morning.
All this time I had thought greatly about my poor mother,
for she had not the slightest idea of what had become
of me. I had been away from April until Christmas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
I had never up to that time any idea of writing a letter
as I had never been to a week-day school, but somehow
or other I had acquired the art of writing. Of course I
could not realize how very deep her grief must have been,
being only a male. We as men love our children, but
our love at best cannot be measured or weighed against
the deep and constant love of a mother for her child.
Now I thought how pleased she would be if I could only
just put these six sovereigns into her hands. I thought
whether I could manage to go for a week to see her, and
return again; but on second thoughts I decided that
would not do at all. So at last I wrote a letter, and told
my mother that I was well and flourishing, but could not
come to see her. If she would come and see me, however,
I would send her the funds to pay her passage. She
answered my letter by return of post to say that she
would come, and so in the course of a few weeks I had the
pleasure of meeting her on the pier, as she landed from
the <i>Atlantic</i>. The judge gave me as many holidays as I
wanted, and so I was able to show my mother about the
Island.</p>

<p>The first thing that surprised her was to see the French
women wheeling heavy barrows of luggage about, while
their lords and masters were swelling about with their
gold-laced caps, gingham blouses, patent leather boots,
and the everlasting pipe in their mouths.</p>

<p>Mother would gaze at the women in the street, and say,
"Well, I have worked hard in my time, but I am very
glad I am not a Frenchwoman." She was not surprised,
she said, that the Duke of Wellington was able with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
handful of Englishmen to go over and thrash them Frenchmen
on their own ground.</p>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed myself during the five weeks
mother stayed with me. Father had given her four
weeks, but I must confess to playing a trick on her so
that she could stay with me another week. On the day
that she was to leave I went down to the steamship office
to ascertain at what time the packet started, and found
it was timed to start at nine o'clock in the evening.
But my mother did not trust quite to that, for she went
herself to learn the hour of departure, so it was no fault
of her own that she was left behind. Well, we had high tea
at six o'clock, and got a few friends together just to
talk away the hours until nine o'clock. So while the
ladies were thus employed, and helping my mother put
her things together, I put the clock back three-quarters
of an hour. No one noticed it, as the clock was in another
room, and it turned out exactly as I desired. We went
off, my mother and I, she shaking hands and bidding her
friends good-bye and I laughing up my sleeve, knowing
full well that the steam-packet would have left. When
we arrived at the pier and she found it had gone without
her she could scarcely believe her own senses. I knew
that she had never been away from her home for twenty-four
hours before, and I also knew that my father would
be dreadfully vexed, especially as he would have to
walk a long way to the Foxwell turnpike to meet the
Weymouth coach. I ought to have been put in the
stocks for practising such a joke, but somehow I felt it
might be years before I should see her again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>I took her over to Elizabeth Castle, and she stood close
by the great gun when it was fired off, bearing the deafening
noise and the vibration under our feet like a real old
soldier; and then we went to Gorée Castle and saw the
oyster fishing; and she was very much amused to see
the oysters as they lay in heaps upon their shells, and to
watch the mice, that swarmed around trying to get a
nibble from the open oysters, which would close up their
shells upon them. Then I took her down to St. Clement's
Bay, where her grandfather, a sergeant-major in one of the
English regiments, landed when he was sent to the island
to clear out the French. At the death of Major Peirson
in the Royal Square the command fell upon my great-grandfather,
who drove the French out of the town at the
point of the bayonet literally into the sea, and at the
time of our visit the guns which were used in that fight
were stuck into the ground along the beach as a memorial
of the occasion.</p>

<p>At the time of my sojourn in Jersey from 1839 to
1847 it contained twelve parishes. The capital town
of St. Heliers contained six or seven churches besides
two Roman Catholic chapels, and several Dissenting
places of worship. There was a fine theatre, and a
Court-house in the Royal Square. This house did duty as
the House of Commons, Guildhall, assize hall, and I know
not what besides. I have seen great doings there when
a new judge was being elected. I have also seen prisoners
tried for various offences, but whether the prisoners
were French or English or of any other nation, the whole
of the business was carried on in the French language.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
If the prisoner at the Bar did not happen to understand
that language so much the worse for him. There was no
such person as an interpreter, and I often heard sentence
passed upon a prisoner who was quite ignorant of the
nature of the trial or sentence until some kind friend
who could speak both languages would tell him what he
was to expect.</p>

<p>Mr. Charles Carus Wilson, a man over seven feet in
height and a member of the English Bar, on one occasion
stood up and told the judge that the prisoner had not
had a fair trial, that he protested against it, and that
he would report the circumstances to Lord Denman,
the Lord Chief Justice. The judge thereupon told Mr.
Wilson that he had insulted the court and must pay a
penalty of £10, and apologise to the court for such an
insult. "Indeed, I shall do neither one nor the other,"
replied Mr. Wilson. "Then," said the judge, "you
must go to prison during Her Majesty's pleasure." "Very
well," replied Mr. Wilson, "here's off to jail." So he
walked through the streets in charge of a constable,
his head and shoulders towering above the heads of the
crowd which had gathered round. In prison they had
to put two bedsteads and beds together to make it long
enough for him to lie down.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson, however, took it very quietly and courteously
and reported the whole matter to Lord Denman,
who sent over a writ of habeas corpus. Of course I
wondered whatever that could be, but the steam packet
arrived on a Sunday morning, covered with flags
and banners, and thousands of people went down to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the sight and wondered what was going to happen next.
I do not know if the judges knew the meaning of it, but
they were nearly frightened out of their wits. Messengers
were sent all over the island to call all the judges together.
On Monday morning they met and consulted, and the
result of their deliberations was that they went themselves
and opened the prison doors and asked Mr. Wilson
if he would please to walk out. Charles Carus Wilson,
however, did not please to walk out. He merely replied,
"You have sent me here for I know not what, and I do
not feel disposed to be sent to prison and taken out again
just as it suits your whims."</p>

<p>So the upshot of it all was that they had to pay Mr.
Wilson's fare and their own to London, and all had to
appear before a judge of the Queen's Bench, and the
Jersey judges were fined £100 each, and the poor woman,
whose trial and sentence of seven years' transportation
for stealing a hen and chicken had caused all the
trouble, was freed.</p>

<p>My employer had often told me that if I had been
a few years older, he would have sent me to Newfoundland
to superintend his business there. As I
was too young to fill such a responsible position, he
proposed that I should join the <i>Anchor</i>, a fine bark of 600
tons. The captain, he said, was a "very nice gentleman,"
and on that vessel I should have an opportunity of
learning the art of navigation, so that eventually I
should be able to take charge of any ship belonging to
the merchant service. I thought this was exceedingly
kind, especially as he said he would provide me with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
an outfit, and I then and there closed with the bargain.
The <i>Anchor</i> was in the harbour and I went on board
and assisted in putting in a stock of provisions, ready
for the voyage to the Brazils. She was to sail in a fortnight,
and I was rather glad that I was born, to fall in
luck's way in the manner I had. There now appeared
a prospect of my being placed in a position worth struggling
for, which I knew was not usually the lot of
one such as I. So I looked forward daily and hourly
for the kind-hearted judge to supply me with the outfit.
When, lo and behold, one morning, a day or two before the
<i>Anchor</i> was ready to start, the judge told me that he
intended to place Jim Drake in my place, because his
father was dead, and he was a poor, friendless lad. "Just
as if I were not a poor, friendless lad," thought I. I don't
think I wished Jim Drake dead, but I did wish that he
had never been born. That he should step in and
just open his mouth and catch the blessing that was
intended for me was almost more than I could bear.</p>

<p>So I had the mortification of seeing Jim Drake go off
in the <i>Anchor</i>, and I felt more disgusted than I can
tell, especially as the skipper was a "very nice gentleman."
But I afterwards found out that after all this
happened for the best. The judge offered me more
than one good situation. He had several other vessels,
besides the <i>Anchor</i>, but to all his offers I turned a deaf
ear. If he had ill-used me, or kicked me and boxed
my ears, I should have forgiven him; but he had deceived
me, and for that offence I could not respect him. So
I left him and sought other employment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>I found work in a large blacksmith's shop, and here I
had to work very hard indeed. I stayed for a time, and
then engaged myself to another merchant. I went on
board his vessel, which was a small sloop trading between
France and the Channel Islands and occasionally visiting
some English port, Plymouth, Poole or Southampton.
Now this old merchant used to go over to Havre or
Granville, proceed a few miles into the country, buy cows
at from £5 to £8 each, and send them on board the <i>Medora</i>,
ordering them to be taken to St. Aubin, Jersey, while
he himself went on before in the steam packet.</p>

<p>The <i>Medora</i> in due course ran into harbour, and there
would be the old sinner waiting to order the cows to
Poole, and at the next tide we would set sail for Poole,
where he again would be waiting to meet us, and the
cattle would be unloaded and he would take them to the
market or drive them round to the farmers and sell them
for pure Jersey cows, thereby gaining an enormous
profit.</p>

<p>One Saturday afternoon when the wind was blowing
a hurricane and the sea rolling and seething in all its
majestic fury, as we were scudding along somewhere
between Guernsey and the Isle of Wight, we saw a fine
bark in the distance, and on nearer approach we found
it was the <i>Anchor</i>, returning from the West Indies laden
with sugar. We got near enough to speak <ins title="Transcriber's Note: omitted in original text">to</ins>
 each other,
and I looked to see if I could make out Jim Drake, but
I failed to do so. The vessel had encountered some
very bad weather for nearly all the bulwarks were gone,
and almost everything that is usually carried on deck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
had been washed away. The men were, like ourselves,
tied fast with a rope's end to prevent their being washed
overboard. After two or three days and nights in the
Channel, we at last found ourselves in Weymouth harbour.
We had been soaking wet and had had no sleep or food, nor
did we seem to require any, but I went to an inn and
got to bed and slept for ten hours. On arriving back in
Jersey the first thing I heard was that Jim Drake, who
had just returned in the <i>Anchor</i>, had summoned his
skipper for cruelly ill-using him while at sea. It appeared
that the <i>Anchor</i> was no sooner out of Jersey than poor
Jim Drake began to be sea-sick. So this skipper, the
"very nice gentleman," took a rope, and the chief mate
took another, and between them they belaboured poor
Jim, one hitting on one side and one on the other. So
this nice pair seem to have taken a delight in ill-using the
poor lad during the whole of the voyage.</p>

<p>One day Jim committed the awful crime of whistling.
No one was allowed to whistle on board except the commander,
and he only under extraordinary circumstances,
such as when there was a dead calm he might whistle for
a breeze. Superstition ran so high on board that if a man
whistled he was considered an evil genius; storm and
tempest, fire and famine, aye, the devil himself would
visit that ship, and from the moment Jim Drake whistled
every man on board became his enemy. The skipper
cursed, and the mate swore, and poor Jim cried for
mercy and said he did not know he was committing an
offence. But they tied him to the mast and both took
a rope and hammered away as if the subject they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
operating upon had been a piece of cast-iron or a block
of granite; and at last one took a handspike and gave
Jim a blow which broke his arm, and as there was no
surgeon the limb was never set. This was the complaint
brought before the court, and when I saw Jim there I
cried for pity as the poor lad stood there with his hand
twisted round, the back being towards his thigh, the
palm outwards, and the whole dangling useless by his
side. Now Jim was an English lad, and the skipper
a Jerseyman, and all the business of the court was carried
on in French. Jim stated his evidence, but there was
not a man amongst that crew who would corroborate it,
and the skipper and the mate were two very respectable
men. Moreover the skipper was such a kind-hearted
gentleman that he had actually given his men a double
allowance of grog on their homeward voyage; so of
course, as in duty bound, they all to a man spoke of his
kind and generous conduct. So poor Jim's complaint fell to
the ground. And not only that, but the skipper took
proceedings against him for trying to defame his fair
character, and poor Jim was sent to prison for three weeks.
I cried with anguish for Jim, yet thanked my lucky
stars that I did not go on board the <i>Anchor</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<h3>RETURN AND MARRIAGE</h3>


<p>I HAD now been in Jersey eight years and things
began to get rather dead there. Work was scarce
and wages very low, and if any one wanted a small job
done, there were always about a dozen men ready to do
it for almost nothing; and what made it so was the
number of Irish pensioners. They had their pensions,
and of course they would do any kind of work for less wages
than any other man who had to live entirely by his
labour. In fact, things were in a state of stagnation
everywhere. I went across to France, and the people
there were quarrelling with King Louis Philippe and
casting all the blame of their poverty upon his shoulders,
and saying how much better they should get on if they
could only have a Napoleon to rule over them. They
were chalking <i>Vive Napoléon</i> upon the pavements and
walls.</p>

<p>I went back to England and found things were not
much better there. Thousands of poor people were
half-starved and half-clothed, and when they asked
for work and wages to buy bread for themselves and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
their little ones, the Commander-in-Chief was ready to
fire a volley of grape shot down the street. England
and some of the continental nations were at very low
water in 1846-7, and I think at their very lowest ebb in
1848. Some monarchs were obliged to abdicate, and in
London in April of that year riot and rebellion were
rampant. Several thousand people paraded the streets
starving. In the House of Commons some one declared
that it would be a wholesome proceeding to hang a few
rebels. Up jumped Fergus O'Connor, and cried, "Whenever
you hang a rebel you should make a point of hanging
a tyrant too, and rebellion would soon die a natural
death." Soldiers were placed in every town in England,
lest the owners of hungry stomachs should show too
much anxiety to fill them with bread. At the same time
it was said that millions of quarters of foreign grain were
brought within sight of the shores of England, but
were thrown into the sea by order of rich merchants
rather than that corn should be brought in to reduce the
price. Such is the greed of man.</p>

<p>The only work that I could get after I left Jersey was
in a canvas manufactory in Somersetshire at eight shillings
a week, and this was considered very good wages then.
Here I found poverty and wretchedness and oppression
supreme. There were about four hundred people employed
in the various departments of this business;
old men and women, nearing four score, and little boys
and girls from five years of age and upwards. Some
worked in the factory, and some who had hand-looms
took their work to their homes. Several of them had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
walk four miles carrying their woof with them, where
they had handlooms; and so these poor toilers
worked from early dawn until ten o'clock at night
weaving their woof into sail-cloth or canvas. When
these poor slaves came to the factory for their
work, the foreman would weigh out to each person so
many pounds of chain and as many of woof to each
person. The weaver had to take it home on his
back and produce exactly forty-six yards length of
canvas two feet wide. Now if he happened to put
a little too much energy or muscular strength into
the work, all the woof would be used up before
forty-six yards were made. Consequently he would
have to send to the factory for a few ounces more woof
to finish the pieces, and the cloth therefore would be a
trifle too stout, and consequently the weaver would be
fined to the tune of any amount, according to the greed
and temper of the master, from sixpence up to five
shillings and sixpence, which was the wage due for weaving
the whole piece. On the other hand if the weaver
happened to be weakly and unable to use the strength
required, he would come to his forty-six yards' length
before he had shot in all his woof. The cloth therefore
would not be quite stout enough, and the poor weaver would
be fined. Any frivolous pretext was resorted to to fine
the workers.</p>

<p>Many a time have I seen poor men or women after
toiling hard all the week coming to the pay office for
their wages, but instead of receiving any being cursed at
and told that it was a very great favour on their employers'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
part to give them work at all. And so these poor slaves
would have to do without the "weaver's ox" (red
herring) for their Sunday dinner. A red herring was the
greatest luxury these poor people could indulge in, and
thrice blest was he who could afford three red herrings
a week. There were many other pretexts for fining
the weaver besides those mentioned. Another was what
was called in weaving a "gout"; that is, in the course of
weaving there were some thick and gouty parts in the
woof, where the thread was twice or thrice as thick as it
should be. If the weaver was not careful, and allowed
one of these thick gouty threads into the texture of the
cloth, he was heavily fined. The cloth was also examined
under a magnifying glass, and if found pin-holey or
spotted, the weaver was fined. All these were certainly
very superficial excuses for fining the people, for the
masters themselves would throw the canvas down on
the floor and walk over it. The cottages where these
poor people had to live and do this weaving were shocking
hovels.</p>

<p>This firm was carried on by a man and his three sons.
Each of the sons took up a certain department. One
superintended the spinning department, another the
bleaching, and the third the weaving. On a certain
Whit Monday at the village club festival an old farmer,
in an after-dinner speech, took the liberty to tell the
three young men that it was very shabby and mean of
them to fine these poor weavers in the manner they did,
and he thought it amounted to little less than downright
robbery. Then the young man from the spinning department<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
jumped up, and with an oath cried, "They," meaning
his brothers, "do not half fine them here. You should
come over to my place and see my books." In less than
a week this man was seized with a fit and fell dead; and
the poor people, in their simplicity, said it was a judgment
sent from Heaven. The owners of the firm evidently did
not think so, for they continued to fine the people as
usual.</p>

<p>On the following Whit Monday more after-dinner
speeches were being made when the head of the bleaching
department boasted that he had six hundred pounds
which he had mulcted from his workers in fines. He
forthwith built a new house and furnished it in grand
style, and sent me to Taunton to buy him a grand piano.
The day for opening the new house was appointed,
friends were invited and every preparation made for a
grand feast. The day arrived, and the young boaster was
riding up and down on his high-mettled white horse inspecting
the arrangements when the horse, treading upon a half-rotten
turnip, plunged and fell, and rolled completely over
its rider, who was taken up and carried into the new
house where he had never lived, a corpse. The simple-minded
people also called this a judgment from above.
Very soon after this a large fire occurred at this factory
which threw a great number of men, women, boys and
girls out of work. As for myself I soon engaged myself
to a solicitor, and my duties varied between serving writs
and gardening. Every time I delivered a writ I had to
be put on my oath the following morning that I had so
delivered, and then I used to receive three shillings and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
sixpence for my trouble. Sometimes I had to make
three or four journeys before I could accomplish the
delivery, as so many well-known gentlemen would cleverly
keep out of my way. On one occasion I had to serve
a writ on a gentleman who always managed to be away
when I called; but my master told me that if I had
reasons for believing that he was at home I should walk
in. The next evening when I called and the servant told
me her master had just gone out, I pushed past her, and
got into the dining-room, where the gentleman was
just cutting away at a piece of roast beef. I handed
the document to him and, bowing politely, retired
as hastily as possible. As I turned to the door I heard
something whirr past my shoulder and strike the wall
beyond. It was the carving knife.</p>

<p>Another difficult case was that of a master carpenter
who lived several miles from my master's office. It was
summer time, and he went away to his works as soon as
it was daylight and was not at home until nine in the
evening. I could never find this gentleman at home
although I called several evenings in succession, and at
last I grew tired of walking so many miles several times a
week. As there was a porch at the door I decided to
sit down there and wait until he did come home. I sat
and dozed until about 3 a.m., when I heard some one
moving inside the house. Presently the door opened,
and out came the gentleman I wanted. He was thunderstruck
to see me there. I delivered the writ into his
hands, and we both said "Thank you," and went our
ways.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>After I had been in this situation two years it was a
very disagreeable blow to me to hear that my master
was retiring from business and would have no further
need of my services. He and I had got on together very
comfortably for two years, and he was a kind employer,
so I was really very sorry.</p>

<p>I was now twenty-five years of age, and, like other
young men, I thought it time to begin to see about
"committing matrimony." I had become acquainted
with Miss Anne Warner, who lived at Henley-on-Thames,
and she decided that she would marry me, if I got a
permanent situation either on the railway or in the
post office. Accordingly, I applied for the railway, and
was appointed as porter at Bristol in May, 1850. The
Bristol and Exeter railway at that time was in its infancy.
Amongst the articles served out to me was a wooden
staff or truncheon, to be used, if necessary, for clearing
the station.</p>

<p>In October of the same year I was married to Miss
Warner at St. Mary Redcliffe's Church, Bristol. I
knew that I was not to remain long at Bristol, so my
wife and I took rooms for a while. I was very soon sent
as signalman to Stoke Canon, a village in Devonshire,
where at that time there was no station, but only a
crossing. I had to leave my wife in Bristol until I could
obtain a suitable home, which I did as soon as possible, as
keeping two homes going was a very expensive thing to
do, and my wages at that time were only 16<i>s.</i> a week.
My only accommodation when on duty, which was twelve
hours a day, or an alternate week's night duty, was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
sort of sentry box&mdash;a wretched affair, especially in cold
weather, and for night duty.</p>

<p>While at Stoke Canon I made a model of the village
church. The only tools I had for this work were a pocket
knife and a hammer. Some time after I added a peal
of bells which were set ringing by putting a penny in a
slot in the roof of the church.</p>

<p>In 1853 our eldest daughter was born, and in the
following year I was removed to Martock in Somersetshire,
where a son was born. In 1857 I was removed to
Durston, and in May another daughter was born. My
wages were then £1 a week, a very small income on
which to keep ourselves and three children and pay rent,
but my wife kept a school and had several neighbours'
children to teach. We were very happy together, and I
was glad that I was born!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>SCIENTIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS</h3>

<h3>[<span class="smcap">By Miss Ellen Langdon</span>]</h3>


<p>THE above chapters were written by my father
Roger Langdon, and I, his daughter, Ellen, am
continuing the story of his life. So I will begin by saying
that the school kept by my mother was conducted in the
same manner as were the church schools at that time.
Everything was very orderly and we just had to mind
our p's and q's.</p>

<p>Our parish church and school were five miles away, so
it was only possible for us to go there occasionally. We
usually made the journey sitting on a trolley which
father pushed part of the way, and then we would clamber
up the railway bank and walk on to church. But there
was another church nearer, to which as soon as we were
big enough father would take us on alternate Sunday
mornings, when he was off duty.</p>

<p>We had a large front room which was used as a schoolroom,
and here we, with our neighbours' children, were
taught reading, writing, arithmetic, spelling, geography,
sewing, and the Catechism. When father was on night
duty (the duty in those days was twelve hours at a time)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
he would be at home in the morning, and sometimes he
would take us for Scripture. In this his teaching was
unorthodox and advanced, and he always gave us plenty
to think about. When later on we went to a school at
Taunton we found ourselves in most subjects in advance
of children who had attended schools in the town.</p>

<p>During the eight years my parents spent at Durston
three more sons were born to them; so there were now
six of us, and I have often wondered since how mother
managed to keep the school going with such a large
family of her own. My grandmother, my mother's
mother, was a frequent visitor, and would also be at
work all day long. My father's father too would often
come, and he used to make us stand by the harmonium
and sing. I would like to say that my grandfather was one
of Father Matthew's earliest converts to teetotalism, and
he tried his best to get others to believe in the same
thing.</p>

<p>At this time father made a harmonium, which proved
such a success that he was able to sell it, and with the
proceeds he bought material to make a second. He also
made a magic-lantern, and made slides of the stars and
sun and moon and comets, and at Christmas time he
would invite the neighbours to see the lantern, and
he would give them all the information he could on the
subject. He also told us about the electricity which was
some day to light up our houses and town and drive our
railways and carriages. He told us about photography, and
how we should live to see "living pictures." Then for
us he made all sorts of mechanical toys&mdash;walking dolls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
wooden horses and boats. The forms which were
used in the schoolroom he also made, as well as tables,
chairs, our boots, and his own, a little carriage for the
smaller children, and later on a perambulator. He was
able to make anything he wished, but of course it all meant
labour, and never a moment's idleness. And he had to
put up with a great deal of enmity on account of his being
so set against the drink traffic, and never going to the
<i>Railway Hotel</i> to spend his earnings.</p>

<p>While we were at Durston we had the pleasure of seeing
Garibaldi. His train was crossed on to another line. We
children were playing as usual on the bank above the
station, and when Garibaldi's carriage stopped right in
front of us of course we all screamed with delight, and
our noise brought everybody out, and the men got so
excited they crawled all over the top of the carriage and
shouted for all they were worth.</p>

<p>In 1865 my father was removed to Taunton. His duty
was at Norton Fitzwarren crossing, where there was no
station, so he had only a small office to sit in, which, as
he still had the night duty, he began to find very trying.
House rent at Taunton was heavy, so mother applied for
a schoolmistress's situation, and she kept this post for
nearly two years. Meanwhile another son was born.
But we were not very happy at Taunton, for father was
often ill during the time we were there.</p>

<p>The school in which mother taught was next to our
house, and was also used on Sundays as a Mission Chapel.
When we first went there they used to chant the <i>Magnificat</i>
and <i>Nunc Dimittis</i>, and a hymn, to the accompaniment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
of an accordion. Father did not like the sound,
especially when he had to sleep on Sunday before going
on night duty; so he offered to lend his new harmonium
if they would take care of it and could find some one to
play it. The curate, the Rev. J. Jackson, was much
pleased with the idea, and he persuaded a crippled lady,
Miss Emma Mockeridge, to undertake the duties of
organist. She used to be wheeled down on Sundays to
play, and twice in the week besides she would gather the
children round her in the schoolroom and teach them the
hymn. So she came in all weathers from quite a long
distance to do this work, and after a time she began to
visit the people who attended the service, and told them
that since Mr. Langdon would not accept any payment
for the use of his harmonium it was their duty to provide
themselves with a new one of their own. Before very
long she succeeded in collecting enough money to buy
one. At this time Mr. Jackson held evening classes for men
and charged them a halfpenny a week. Father with
some others went to him to learn Greek, and got on very
well with it. He greatly enjoyed these classes, and in later
life would say how grateful he was for them.</p>

<p>While we were at Taunton there was an election, and
father had a vote. A great deal of bribery went on;
indeed the Conservative member was afterwards unseated
for bribery. Mr. Henry James (now Lord James) was the
Liberal candidate, and he won the election. My father
told us all about it, and said if any one meeting us in the
town, or calling at the house, should offer to give us
children anything we must on no account take anything.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
I do not know who the people were, but they mostly called
in the evening, and would offer us groceries and other
things. One evening I had been to the station to meet
father, when a gentlemanly looking person came up to
him, saying, "Mr. Langdon, I believe."</p>

<p>Father raised his hat and said, "Yes, that is my
name."</p>

<p>"You have got a vote?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have."</p>

<p>"Well, are you going to give it to us?"</p>

<p>"That is my business, not yours."</p>

<p>"Come now, don't be a fool," said the gentleman,
"you have got a little family; what will you do it for?"
at the same time holding up one finger. "I am not to be
bought," father replied. The gentleman then went on
holding up fingers till he had got all his ten fingers up,
and father at last cried, "No, I tell you no," to which
the other replied, "You thundering fool." Father raised
his hat with "Thank you, and you are another," and off
we went.</p>

<p>My father was deeply interested in astronomy, which
he had studied a great deal with the help of books, and
he had bought celestial and terrestrial globes. Now
he wanted a telescope. Mr. Nicholetts, a dear old gentleman
who lived at Petherton, had a telescope; and he
often invited father to his house to look through it,
and this gave father great pleasure and increased his ambition
to possess one of his own. So for a few shillings he
bought some second-hand lenses, and soon succeeded in
making a small telescope, with a 1-1/2-inch reflector mounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
on a wooden stand and swivel. This small instrument
only whetted his desire for something better; so he sold
it for 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and with the money obtained materials for
another. After many difficulties and disappointments,
which by sheer luck and hard work he surmounted, this
second telescope was at last completed. This one had a
four-inch reflector, and with its aid the ring and some
of the satellites of the planet Saturn could be seen. The
crescent form of Venus and some of the nebulæ were also
plainly visible. And when father first saw the moon
through it he said he was fairly astonished, for up to
that time he had no idea how much of the physical features
of the moon could be seen.</p>

<p>In 1867 father was appointed station-master at Silverton
in Devonshire. It was at the end of 1868 that we
left Taunton and took up our abode in our new home;
and thus began what father always described as the happiest
time of his life. For one thing he had from this
time forward no more night duty, and his health improved
considerably in consequence, so that he became stronger
than he had been for many years. He greatly rejoiced,
too, that there was no drinking bar at this station.
Another great advantage was that we were now within
reach of Exeter where there was a good school to which
the younger children could be sent daily by train. In
March 1870 my youngest sister was born; so now there
were eight of us. But the following year my eldest
brother was killed by an accident at the station. This
was a terrible blow to both my parents, and the trouble
turned father's auburn hair as white as snow. At Silverton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
father made many friends, amongst them Sir Thomas
Acland and our good rector, Rev. H. Fox Strangways
and his lady.</p>

<p>In 1870 my father became acquainted through the
<i>English Mechanic</i> with Dr. Blacklock, and this gentleman
gave him advice regarding the building of his telescopes;
but it was all done by letter, for they never met, and it
was wonderful how Dr. Blacklock found time with all his
work to write so many letters as he did. Father also
received letters from Mr. Nasmyth, the inventor of the
steam-hammer, on the same subject. Mr. Nasmyth
took great interest in him and would write two or three
sheets at a time, pointing out the difficulties and explaining
how they might be overcome, and drawing diagrams
of the tools he would need. After father had made
the speculum, which he found exceedingly difficult, it
had to be silvered on the front surface; and on this
point Dr. Blacklock gave him valuable information
which enabled father to do it successfully at the very first
attempt.</p>

<p>In 1874 father made a model in plaster of Paris of the
visible hemisphere of the moon, showing five hundred
principal objects, hollows, craters, and mountains. This
model he afterwards presented to the Devon and Exeter
Institute. Mr. C. R. Collins of Teignmouth once wrote
an article describing the discovery of a new crater on the
moon by Dr. Hermann J. Klein of Cologne. Going to
his observatory father was able to show on this model of
the moon, as the result of his own observations, this very
crater.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>Father had now made two telescopes, but he hoped
to make another and still better one; so he set to work,
and it was in the making of this that he received so much
valuable advice from Mr. Nasmyth and Dr. Blacklock.</p>

<p>This third telescope was a beautiful instrument. It
had a six-inch speculum with a five foot focal length.
With this he was enabled to detect certain markings upon
the planet Venus. In 1871 he read a paper before the
Royal Astronomical Society in London upon this subject.
He said afterwards that he never was so nervous in his life
as on this occasion, and he wished the earth would open
and swallow him up. But his paper was very well received,
and commended.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> He also made over a thousand
drawings and photographs of the moon's surface.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Webb quotes from this paper in his book <i>Celestial Objects
for Common Telescopes</i>. My father's observations are also mentioned
in Clarke's <i>History of Astronomy During the Nineteenth
Century</i>.</p></div>

<p>Much as father had accomplished, he was still bitten
with the idea that his telescope was not so good as he
would like, although it was a splendid one, and had
cost him many weary hours' hard work to make. So he
sold it for £10, and in the year 1875 set about making his
fourth telescope&mdash;a very noble instrument, for which he
had to build an observatory. He describes it thus: "An
8-1/4-inch silver-on-glass reflector mounted in a stout zinc
tube, which turns in a cast-iron cradle on its own axis.
The focal length is seven feet. There is a diagonal place for
viewing the stars and a specially prepared glass wedge for
observing the sun. The whole is mounted as an equatorial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>upon a strong cast-iron stand. It had two stout brass
right ascension circles divided to 10 seconds, and declination
circles divided to 5 minutes of arc. The telescope is
furnished with a driving clock which keeps the celestial
object in the field of view. The observatory is a circular
iron building with conical-shaped revolving roof, two swing
flaps of which give the required opening to the sky."</p>

<p>This telescope took a long time to make, and night
after night through many a weary month, when station
duty was done, father would work at it for hours
together in his home-made work-shop. But, as usual, the
want of funds hampered him a good deal, and he found many
difficulties to overcome; but he worked away with intense
enthusiasm, and with the advice of Dr. Blacklock and Mr.
Nasmyth, he at last completed this Newtonian equatorial
reflecting telescope fitted with a finder with Ramsden
eye-piece. He added to it a trap for taking photographs,
the invention of his own brain, and in visiting Greenwich
Observatory some years later he was pleased to find that
the apparatus in use there for the same purpose was
almost identical with his own. With this telescope my
father photographed the transit of Venus and took
also several pictures of the sun and of the moon.</p>

<p>To make his first telescope in 1865 he bought some
second-hand lenses for a few shillings, and by means of a
turning lathe he turned a stick upon which to roll the
tin case, according to the size of the lens.</p>

<p>The second telescope was a much more difficult undertaking
for one whose acquaintance with mechanical processes
was entirely self-acquired. He was as a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
groping in the darkness. To obtain the special glass
necessary for the speculum; to grind it to the most
delicately accurate shape and density; to polish and
silver the speculum; to make the metal tube to the requisite
size and scale; to mount it with the necessary
adjustments and accuracy; all these were so many
enigmas which only his intense enthusiasm and perseverance
enabled him to solve.</p>

<p>To grind the speculum of the third telescope a special
and very curious tool was necessary, and here Mr. Nasmyth
gave father valuable information and sent a drawing of
the tool. After making this tool according to Mr. Nasmyth's
pattern, father found it applicable to metal specula
only, and unsuitable to glass inasmuch as it would not
parabolize, or work in the figure of a parabola. This was
a great blow. However he eventually surmounted it
by using Ross's machine, a description of which he
came across; after considerable inquiry. This grinding
completed, he succeeded in polishing his speculum with
a disc of pitch squares, an apparatus which gave him
much thought and trouble. Then came the silvering, and
then the rolling and soldering of the tube, which was
accomplished by means of a circular block of wood turned
in the lathe to the required size. Here another difficulty
presented itself, for when it was done, the wood was
found immovably fixed inside the tube, and it became
necessary to procure a steel augur to bore it out.</p>

<p>However, this taught father something, for in making
the next telescope he used a number of laths fixed together
and turned in the lathe. One of them was cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
through diagonally so that the two parts when separated
formed wedge-shaped sections, which could be readily
knocked out when the case had been fixed; and thus the
whole circular bundle could be easily removed. I know
that the building of these telescopes was real hard work,
and the difficulties and disappointments they involved
were numerous, and were only overcome by sheer hard
work and indomitable perseverance. The fourth telescope
he had reason to be proud of. He was assisted
with the adjustment of this as well as in making the pitch
plate with which to polish the speculum by Mr. Newton,
a gentleman from Taunton. This was the telescope for
which father built the observatory, and it has been described
as a real triumph of skill.</p>

<p>Many a time after his day's work was done he would
take his magic-lantern and give a lantern lecture on
astronomy. He also wrote a paper, "A Letter from the
Man in the Moon," which was published in the <i>Exe
Valley Magazine</i>. Another paper, "A Journey with
Coggia's Comet," appeared in <i>Home Words</i>. Some of his
mechanical toys, Stoke Canon Church with its peal of
bells, ships rocking on the ocean, and others, have often
been shown at church sales of work, and so helped the
funds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>CLOSING YEARS</h3>


<p>ON several occasions during the early years at Silverton,
my father had trouble with drunken passengers.
On one occasion a certain book salesman came to
the station and called for a ticket to Exeter, for which he
tendered 5<i>d.</i> The parliamentary fare being 7<i>d.</i>, my father
asked him for the other 2<i>d.</i> The man began to abuse
him and got on to the line, and would have been killed by
an express, but father jumped down and dragged him
back just in time to save both their lives. The man
then struck father in the face with his umbrella and swore
tremendously. After some trouble father succeeded in
placing him outside the station gate and locked him out.
The man finally paid 7<i>d.</i> for his ticket, and then threatened
to kill father. Of course he was summoned and had
to pay heavy fines. Father wrote regarding this case:
"If I had caused the death of this man, I should have
had to do at least twelve months' hard labour in one of
Her Majesty's country mansions, and there would have
been two and a half columns in <i>The Times</i>, <i>The Standard</i>,
and <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>, expatiating on the carelessness
of railway officials; but having saved his life at great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
risk of my own, I received as complete and satisfactory
a blackguarding as it is possible to conceive."</p>

<p>On another occasion father was not so fortunate in
averting disaster. In 1879 a lady came to the station in
her carriage to meet some friends who were going to spend
Easter with her. It was the day before Good Friday,
and the trains were very late. The friends were coming
in the down train from London, and she also wanted to
see her son-in-law who was passing in the up train.
While waiting she constantly crossed the line, first to the
down platform, then to the up. A down train was signalled
and off she went to the down platform. She was
a very genial person and had been chatting pleasantly
to every waiting passenger. This train was an express,
and as soon as it passed by she saw an up train approaching.
She immediately attempted to cross the line,
probably thinking it was the stopping train, instead of
which it was an express. Father rushed out to warn her,
but it was too late, for the engine was upon her, and she
was instantly killed. The shock was very great to both
of my parents and they could not sleep for weeks.</p>

<p>Up to 1874 father was single-handed, and used often
to be on duty from 6 a.m. till 2 o'clock the following
morning waiting for a coal train which used to come at
any time in those days. Afterwards a signalman was
appointed, and then father's duty hours were 6 a.m. till
10 p.m. There are several people still living, both rich
and poor, who could record the great courtesy they received
at Silverton station. Many a time he would help
some poor person along the lanes with her babies or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
her bundles, or show the way with his lamp to some
benighted place perhaps two or three miles distant.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1875 father was very ill, and when he
got better he was ordered away for a change of air, and
I had the pleasure of going with him. We visited some
relations and went on to London. If we had gone to the
dullest place in the world I should have been quite happy
so long as father was with me, for on all occasions he was
just the same age as his children. But as it was we went
to all the interesting places, and I don't know which of
us enjoyed things the most.</p>

<p>About this time the Great Western railway company
took over what had been known as the Bristol and Exeter
railway, and began to lay down narrow gauge-lines. The
line near Silverton runs through a valley, picturesque
but wet. The station itself is about thirty feet lower
than the floor of Exeter Cathedral. For several weeks
during this time there had been a great deal of rain and
the valley contained more water than usual. Torrents
ran down from the hills and flooded the valley of the Culm
to a depth of over five feet. A culvert which drains the
main part of these hills passes under the railway close to
Silverton station, and this became blocked by two
hurdles which had been carried down the stream and
become fixed in an upright position right across the
mouth of the culvert. Consequently, leaves, brushwood,
thousands of apples and other rubbish got fixed on one
side of the hurdles, completely staying the torrent.
The railway was quickly flooded, and at 10.30 p.m., after
the station was closed for the night, down came the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
express known as "Madame Neilson's train," because it
conveyed her regularly from London to her Devonshire
home. Owing to the work of laying down the narrow-gauge
rails there were a great many timbers collected on
that part of the line, and these were lifted by the sudden
flood, and floated about on the water. Mother went
to look at the flood just in time to see the express coming
at a speed of sixty or seventy miles an hour, and she
wondered if it would get safely through. The thought
had scarcely entered her head when she saw the great
engine rear itself up, as if it were a real live thing, then
as suddenly drop down again, and she knew that it was
off the line. The passengers got a shaking, but were otherwise
none the worse, not even wetting their feet as they
passed over planks laid across from their carriages to the
platform. Madame Neilson and Madame Patti were
both among the passengers, so here was a lively night for
my mother and brothers. There is no railway hotel or
other house near, so mother did her best to accommodate
all these people, who were dreadfully hungry. They
soon ate up all that was in our house, and there they had
to wait for a relief train from Exeter. My two young
brothers were called out of their beds, to escort two
gentlemen to the village of Silverton two miles away.
They started off full of excitement, and when they were
about a quarter of a mile away the water was nearly up
to their necks; but they all four went on, and my brothers
had to try and get some bread for the hungry people.
So they arrived in due course wet through and tired out,
but they were none the worse the next day. Altogether it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
was a most exciting night. Father traced the origin of
the flood and drew up plans, and received the thanks of
the railway company.</p>

<p>Now there are some people, especially those who live in
large towns, who may think that a small country station
is a very dull place to live in, but that is because they have
never tried it. Apart from such occasional and exciting
events as that just described, the country has interests
and amusements of its own. When country people are
waiting for a local train, particularly if it is a market
train, and all the passengers, both rich and poor, are more
or less acquainted with each other, every topic is discussed,
and if the station-master has a few minutes to
spare his opinion is sure to be asked. For example, when
Doctor Temple was appointed Bishop of Exeter, it made
such a stir that it was the talk of every one, and father's
opinion was asked by every passenger. Father had read
about Dr. Temple, though he had not seen him. His
reply to their question was always the same: "I rejoice
to know that Dr. Temple is appointed; such men are
needed in the Church very much indeed. He will be
the right man in the right place, and he will thoroughly
do his duty, and he will be a hard worker. Moreover,
he will make the clergy work, and it is a thousand pities
that so many churchmen have not yet realized what a
strong man they will have amongst them."</p>

<p>Then up spake a countryman, "Then, du yu 'old way
un bein' a tay-totler, Mr. Langdon?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course I do," replied father. "That is
the essence of the whole matter, and that is just why the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
Exeter people are against him; but I for one am thankful,
and I think it a great gain to the Church of England to
have at last a bishop who holds such opinions."</p>

<p>"Well now to be sure, Mr. Langdon, I knowed thee
was long-headed, and I knowed thee was an ole Liberal,
now I knows thee beest an ole tay-totler."</p>

<p>Father was a broad Churchman, and wished for Church
reform. He liked to hear good music and used to go
regularly on Sunday evenings to Thorverton Church, as
the services there were very much to his liking. He used
to say that the Church was behind the times, and did
not reach the people generally, chiefly because the clergy
were all taken from one class, and in many cases they
did not understand the poor. They were also educated
over the heads of the people. In politics he was a
supporter of Mr. Gladstone.</p>

<p>My father had now taken up photography and had
made a collapsible dark room that he could carry on his
back. He succeeded, after a few failures, in taking
some very good pictures of the moon in 1880; and in
December 1882 he took a good one of the transit of
Venus. He also made an instantaneous shutter to his
camera, by the help of which he was able to get some
very good pictures, notably one of the old broad-gauge
train known as the "Flying Dutchman." This was
before dry plates were invented. The next thing he
made was an excellent camera. A gentleman named
Mr. Wellington gave him information both in regard
to this and to photography in general, for which father
was very grateful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>In the winter of 1881 there was very deep snow, and
our house was snowed up to a height of several feet, so
that before he could open the station father had to dig
his way out. No trains ran that day, and only one up
and one down on the two succeeding days. After that
the line was pretty clear again.</p>

<p>In 1888 father and mother received another fearful
blow by the death of my youngest brother, after a very
short illness, at his lodgings in Exeter. After this time
father never appeared to be very well, and before long
his health entirely gave way.</p>

<p>During these years several visitors came to father's
observatory, among them Mr. Clifton Lambert, son of
the General Manager of the Great Western Railway.
This gentleman wrote a sketch of father's life, which
was published in three different papers, <i>Wit and Wisdom</i>,
June 1889, the <i>Great Western Railway Magazine</i>, September
1889, and in the summer number <i>Western Weekly
News</i>, 1894, just one month before he died. Visitors
would call at all hours, in the day to see the spots on
the sun, and in the evening and at night to see the moon
and stars.</p>

<p>For many a year father had been a wonder to the
simple country folk. They could not understand a
man devoting his spare time to the study of the heavens,
for the mere love of science. They had an idea that he
could "rule the planets." Father used to say that he
was astonished at the amount of superstition prevailing
in the minds of all sorts of people, not only the uneducated.
Even well-educated people would ask him if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
could "rule their planets." He would say that he was
ashamed to hear them ask such a question. People
would come from long distances in the dead of night
to have a look through the telescope. When asked how
he had achieved so much, and brought up a large family
in respectability, his answer was: "It is through the
woman that the Almighty gave me; she has done the
most."</p>

<p>It was in March 1894 that I went home to find father
suffering from a complaint from which he could not hope
to recover. He got gradually worse, and in July I was
sent for again to come at once if I wished to see him alive.
Mother had done all she could do for him, and I was very
much shocked to find him suffering dreadfully. But he
was very cheerful, only longing for his sufferings to end.
It was a painful time, but as we all gathered around his
bed, he often made us laugh by his jokes. Then there
were quieter moments when he prayed the Almighty
to take him. On the evening before he died, he repeated
part of Psalm li. to me and some hymns, and that was the
last. He passed peacefully away in the morning.</p>

<p>Through the kindness of Sir Thomas Acland, he was
buried in the private burial ground of the Acland family,
near his two sons.</p>

<h4><i>Communicated by J. Norman Lockyer, F.R.S.</i></h4>

<h4>[From the "Monthly Notices" of the Royal Astronomical
Society. Vols. 31-32, June, 1872]</h4>

<p>On May 1, 1871, I had a good view of the planet Venus, but
I could not at first see her to my satisfaction as her light was
so bright. She had more the appearance of a miniature sun
than a star; but I put a diaphragm of blackened card in the
eye-piece, and made a small hole through its centre with a
piece of hot wire. I found this arrangement keep out to a
great extent the glaring rays. I also sometimes used a slip
of slightly tinted glass in front of the eye lens; this enabled
me to bring the planet entirely under subjection. Her shape
was that of the moon when a little more than half full. I
distinctly saw a dull, cloudy-looking mark along her bright
limb, curving round parallel to it, and extending nearly across
the disc, each end terminating in a point; joining this at the
eastern extremity was another and darker mark of a club shape,
its small end joining the point of the mark previously described.
I watched these marks for half an hour. I saw some
marks again the next evening, but before I could examine
them the planet was hidden behind some clouds. On May 6,
at 7.45 p.m., there was a cloud-like mark extending straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
across the disc, and a club-shaped mark nearly in the centre,
with its small end nearly touching the straight cloud. On
the western limb another dark mark had made its appearance;
it was not quite so large as the other, and it was not club-shaped;
but its sides were parallel to each other till they
approached the straight cloud, when they appeared to divide,
each side curving round away from the other. I took much
interest in watching these spots, as I had read that it was
very doubtful whether any marks had ever been seen on this
planet. I called several men to look at them, and they were
able to describe them, although they had no previous knowledge
or idea of what they were likely to see. One man was
very confident it was the moon he was looking at, but when
I pointed out to him that the moon was not in the neighbourhood,
he said he thought it was the moon, because he could
plainly see the dark patches on its surface.</p>

<p>On May 13, at 7.30 p.m., there was a dark mark of a pear
shape, extending from near the western edge to two-thirds
the distance across the bright disc. This mark was not so
dark as those seen on the 1st and 6th, but it was much larger.</p>

<p>On July 28, at 8 p.m., there were visible five dusky marks
along the planet's terminator, and one nearly in the centre of
the crescent, but they were not so well defined as those before
described; but what seemed to me more remarkable was that
the southern horn was rounded off considerably, whilst the
northern horn was quite sharp, and ran out to a very fine
thread-like point.</p>

<p>On October 13, at 5.45 a.m., I saw Venus as a beautiful
little crescent. She was well defined, and both horns were as
sharp as the finest pointed needles. I think I detected a
dusky cloud-like mark about half way from the centre to the
northern horn; but I am not quite sure about this as I had
to leave my telescope before I could complete my sketch.</p>

<p>On October 25, at 8.10 a.m., I was gratified with a sight
which I had waited for and longed to see for many years;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
that was to have a good view of Venus by daylight. I now
had the longed-for opportunity, and it turned out as I expected.
The superior light of the sun overcame that of the planet to
such an extent that I was able to see her better than I had
ever seen her before. I could now plainly perceive the jagged
nature of the terminator, the unevenness of which could not
be mistaken; but what was very remarkable, the northern
horn was bent in towards the centre of the planet; it appeared
as if a notch had been cut in the inside, and a slice cut off
from the outside.</p>

<p>I have no idea what was the cause of this appearance; I
had never seen it so before, neither do I recollect ever having
read of such a phenomenon. I did not perceive any markings
on this occasion, but there was a kind of haziness along the
whole length of the terminator; but I considered this at the
time to have belonged to the terminator rather than to any
markings on the disc. The terminator on this occasion was
inky black.</p>

<p>On November 9 I saw Venus every half hour during the day
up to one o'clock. I made a sketch at 12.20 p.m. I could
now distinctly see the jagged terminator; the nature of which
was so much like that of the moon as it was possible to conceive;
except that if we compare the moon's terminator to a
piece of network, that of Venus would be represented by a
piece of fine lace. I could also see some thin, cloudy marks on
her disc. The southern horn was very sharp; the northern one
was a trifle rounded.</p>

<p>I saw Venus on February 5, 1870 (a few days before her
inferior conjunction with the sun), and the bright part was an
exceedingly beautiful fine crescent; but I and several other
people could see the whole body of the planet in the same
manner as we see the dark limb of the moon when <i>Earth-shine</i>
is falling upon it; but I did not make any sketch at the time.</p>

<p>I have observed Venus a great many times besides those mentioned
above, having made it my special work to do so, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
have on several occasions strongly suspected markings to be
visible; but I have not mentioned them, and have only described
those times upon which I have no doubt of what I had
seen.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Observations of the Planet Venus, with a 6-inch
Silvered Glass Reflector. By R. Langdon</span></h4>

<h4>[From the "Monthly Notices" of the Royal Astronomical
Society, June 1873. Vol. 33, Page 500.]</h4>

<p>On January 2, 1873, there was a cloudy mark, of a semicircular
shape, extending nearly across the disc, and a dark
spot in the centre; the illuminated disc itself was singularly
egg-shaped. Bad weather prevented me from constantly
observing this planet, as I should like to have done, but on
April 17, at 8 p.m., I was viewing the planet with one of Mr.
Browning's excellent achromatic eye-pieces, when I saw two
exceedingly bright spots on the crescent&mdash;one close to the
terminator towards the eastern horn, and the other in the
centre of the crescent. These spots appeared like two drops
of dew; they were glistening in such a manner as to cause the
surrounding parts of the bright crescent to appear dull by contrast.
Cloudy weather prevented me seeing the planet
again until the 19th, when the spots had disappeared, but the
planet on this occasion was seen through the Aurora, and the
irregular and uneven appearance of the terminator was most
beautifully depicted. The whole body of the planet also
was distinctly visible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<h3>APPENDIX IV</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">A Letter from the Man in the Moon</span></h4>

<h4>(<i>Left for the Editor at the Railway Station</i>)</h4>

<h4>[Reprinted from the <i>Exe Valley Magazine</i>]</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Cousin</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>Knowing how exceedingly anxious you must be to find out
all you can respecting this little planet on which I live, I
take this opportunity to send you a few lines to give you some
little account of it.</p>

<p>The moon, in many particulars, is like the earth on which
you dwell; and perhaps there is no better way to give you
a little more information about this planet than by instituting
a comparison between it and the earth.</p>

<p>I must presume you are aware that the earth is a globe,
nearly round, like an orange; its circumference is about 24,000
miles, and its diameter 8,000. The moon in this respect is
like the earth, being also a globe, but it is only 2,160 miles in
diameter, and about 7,000 miles in circumference. It would
therefore take forty-nine moons to compose a globe the size
of the earth. If you will take two threads and suspend
an orange and a small cherry at six feet apart, you will then
have a fair representation of the relative size and distance
from each other of the earth and the moon. But the earth
and the moon are not suspended by any visible or tangible
object, but were launched forth in the beginning, and are kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
in their places by the balance of attraction, constantly revolving,
and travelling onward by the direction of Him who also
created the insignificant worm, and whose tender care is over
all His works.</p>

<p>You know, dear cousin, that the surface of the earth is
diversified with large continents, which are dotted with chains
of mountains and high hills, some of which are in a state
of volcanic eruption. You have also great oceans of water
lying in the hollows of your world. In the moon, too, we
have mountains and hills, some of them very high and steep,
thrown up ages ago by volcanic agency, though at present
there is not a trace of existing fire or volcanic action, and you
may safely consider the whole mass of the moon to be a huge,
exhausted, burnt-out cinder. Your mountains and hills are
denuded&mdash;worn down&mdash;their sharp points and angles are worn
away by frost, rain, and snow, and other atmospheric
influences which have been constantly acting upon them for
ages; but here in the moon we have no such thing as an
atmosphere: we therefore have neither clouds nor rain, nor
frost nor snow; and in the words of the poet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here are no storms, no noise,</span><br />
<span class="i0">But silence and eternal sleep.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>All here is as quiet and silent as the grave. Sometimes, from
the great heat of the sun, great masses of rock will split and
crack, and come tumbling down from the sides of the cliffs;
yet if you were close on the spot you would not hear the
slightest sound, because there is no atmosphere by which
sound can be propagated and conveyed. Your fields are
clad with verdure, and your pastures with flocks, so that
as one of your inspired poets has sung&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The valley stands so thick with corn</span><br />
<span class="i0">That they do laugh and sing,</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>but neither verdure nor corn can exist upon the moon, as no
plant-life can grow in a vacuum where there is no moisture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>The crater mountains of the moon are its grand peculiarities.
We see here that its whole surface has been upturned, convulsed
and dislocated with forces of the greatest activity, the results
of which remain to this day; so that our rocks are not
levelled down by the fury of tempests, nor smoothed by the
constant flow of water, as your earthly mountains are, but
stand up in all their primitive sharpness. These volcanic
craters are of all sizes, from fifty yards to as many miles
across, and in the centre of some of them there stand up lofty
hills. Now if you could take up your position upon the highest
peak of one of these central hills at the time the sun was
rising, you would see the tops of the distant mountains forming
a circle round you all illuminated by the sun's light;
but as there is no atmosphere, there is no twilight, and consequently
the great valley immediately beneath your feet
would be in the very blackest of darkness.</p>

<p>I know that you and others have often wondered what those
dark grey patches are which you can see upon the moon, even
with the unassisted eye. Some people call them "The man in
the moon, and his bundle of sticks," and the story goes that I
went stealing sticks on a Sunday, and for my wickedness
was banished (sticks and all) into the moon! Now I most
strongly protest against this cruel libel; I never stole any
sticks, even on a week-day, much less on a Sunday, and I
must say the people must have dreadful weak eyesight, and
a dreadfully strong imagination, to see anything in these dark
patches that can possibly be stretched into the shape of a
man with a bundle of sticks at his back. So I hope you will
kindly contradict this calumnious story whenever you can;
indeed, in writing, it was partly my object to ask you to do so.</p>

<p>One of the smallest dark markings that you can see on the
moon with the naked eye is known to selenographers by the
name of Mare Crisium, or the Crisian Sea; its width across
from north to south is 280 miles, and its length is 354 miles
from east to west, and it contains about 78,000 square miles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
more than half as much again as the area of England and
Wales&mdash;rather a large size for a bundle of sticks, I opine.
There are several other dark or grey patches on the moon,
some smaller and some larger than the Mare Crisium, but they
are all the beds or bottoms of what were once oceans, seas,
and lakes, the waters of which have been dried up or evaporated
many years ago. Some think they have all gone
over to that side of the moon which never turns round towards
you, but I can tell you that is not the case; for if any
water did exist on the moon's surface, the attraction of the
earth would certainly draw it round to that side nearest to
you, and so you would be able to see some signs of it, as well
as clouds and vapours which would rise from it during the
time of full moon.</p>

<p>There are many other objects of interest, which I could
mention to you, but I must draw my letter to a close; I
will therefore only just give you the names of a few of those
dark hollows which you can see with the unaided eye when
the full moon is shining brightly.</p>

<p>There is the "Sea of Tranquillity": its width from north
to south is 432 miles, and from east to west 425 miles. There
are also the "Sea of Serenity," the "Sea of Fogs," the "Frozen
Sea," the "Sea of Vapours" and the "Gulf of Rainbows."
This last named will appear to you of a greenish tint, and it
is surrounded on nearly all sides with very lofty and
steep mountains, some of them more than 15,000 feet high.
Then there are the "Ocean of Storms," the "Gulf of Dew,"
and the "Sea of Humours." This last will also appear of a
green tint; it is very level, and is 280 miles across.</p>

<p>Next come the "Sea of Nectar" and the "Sea of Fertility."
All these were named "seas," because the ancient
astronomers thought they contained water, and that they
really were seas; but you are aware now that they contain
no trace of water, so I need not inform you of that fact. And
now dear cousin, I sincerely hope that what I have written will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
interest you, and if it does, and you will kindly let me know,
I will write you another letter at some future time; but for
the present I will say&mdash;Farewell!</p>

<p>
Your faithful servant and attached cousin,</p>

<h3>APPENDIX V</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">A Journey with Coggia's Comet</span></h4>

<h4>[Reprinted from <i>Home Words</i>]</h4>

<p>This comet, which last year excited so much interest,
is supposed by some to be the same which appeared in the
year 1737. If so, it is beyond the power of the human intellect
to calculate the number of miles (millions upon millions)
which it has travelled since that date; we may, however,
in imagination, travel with it on one of its journeys.</p>

<p>Starting off then, as soon as it has made its perihelion passage,
we are carried in the course of about six months to such
a distance that this comparatively insignificant world (of
which nevertheless we are all anxious to get a good slice)
disappears entirely from our view, and the larger planets of
this system are reduced to mere specks of light. The sun
itself, which here scorches us at noonday, only appears there
as a very minute star, just a small yellow speck. But meantime
other suns, some of them of far greater magnitude and
superior brilliancy than the sun we have left behind, gradually
come into sight, and some of the "nebulæ," which appear
to us here as so many bits of faint hazy light, some of them
no larger than a crown piece, now appear to our unassisted
vision in all the glorious majesty of suns and worlds and systems
of worlds, all revolving round each other in the most
regular and systematic order; for, as Milton says in <i>Paradise
Lost</i>, "Order is Heaven's first law."</p>

<p>After our steed had carried us for the space of about seventy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
years in a direct onward course through systems of worlds
by us from this world unseen, we should begin to return homewards,
but by a different route from that by which we went
out; and we should consequently have a constantly varying
scene presented to our view. How awfully grand, for instance,
would be the change, as we gradually lost sight of
our yellow sun, to find ourselves arriving in sight and
under the influence of a sun of a rich crimson red colour, and
again after a few years to find ourselves in the presence of a
green or a blue sun! Yet it is more than probable that such
would be the case, for the sky is spangled with suns of all
colours.</p>

<p>In the course of about 137 years from the time when we set
out we should be returned sufficiently near to this world to
enable its inhabitants to catch sight of our steed's tail. And
then, after all this long journey among the stars of 137 years,
we should have seen but a mere atom, just one grain of the
works of Him who knows the number of the hairs of our
heads, and without whom a sparrow doth not fall to the
ground!</p>

<p>Suppose we now inquire, What is the comet's probable
business in coming amongst us once in 137 years? Are its
duties those of a messenger or a scavenger, or both? It is
well known that the sun is continually giving off light and
heat, and consequently it must of necessity be gradually
exhausting itself. It has been computed that were the mass
of the sun composed of Newcastle coal, with exhaustion going
on at the present rate, the whole mass would be burnt out in
25,000 years. If the sun, then, is gradually being exhausted
by giving off light and heat to his family of planets, and if the
planets cannot give any portion of it back to him, seeing
that they are entirely dependent upon the sun for their own
physical and material existence&mdash;how is the sun's strength
to be kept up so as to be equal to the demands made upon
him?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>It is but reasonable to suppose that the comets (of which the
firmament is said to be as full as the sea is of fishes) should
bring some subtle fluid of which this system is being exhausted,
and at the same time collect and carry away to other systems
some noxious gas or other essence of which we have a superfluity,
but which might be quite essential to the well-being of
some other system; and that so a sort of healthy circulation
in the universe around us might be kept up.</p>

<p>Ought we not, therefore, to look upon the appearance of
a comet with some such feelings (only in a wider sense) as we
would hail the arrival of a ship from a long voyage to a foreign
clime, feeling sure it must come laden with some good store
for the benefit of those whose business it is to stay at home
performing faithfully their own several duties in their own
several spheres?</p>

<h3>APPENDIX VI</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Planet Venus</span></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Nelly-Bly</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>According to promise I send a sketch showing the different
positions of the planet Venus with regard to the earth during
the past few months.</p>

<p>I am astonished, not to say grieved, at the very great
amount of ignorance and superstition which exists respecting
the apparition of this planet recently as a "morning star."</p>

<p>If you will refer to the sketch I will try and point out the
various positions.</p>

<p>June 13, 1887, Venus began to appear low down towards
the western horizon as an "evening star," but as the evenings
were then light I suppose it did not attract public attention.
Daily, however, the planet for a time was seen&mdash;after
sunset&mdash;higher and higher in the western sky, until August 16,
when it arrived in such a position with respect to the earth
that it sent towards us the greatest amount of reflected light
that it is possible it can send at any given time. The planet
travelling through space in her orbit at the rate of sixty-nine
thousand miles an hour overtook the earth (which is travelling
in the same direction at fifty-eight thousand miles an
hour) on September 21, when she was exactly in a straight line
between us and the sun&mdash;called astronomically, "inferior
conjunction." The moment she passes this point she becomes
a morning star. She still moves on and leaves the earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
behind, and when she arrives at the position shown on October
28 she is at her greatest brilliancy as a morning star. From
this time the planet's distance from us is rapidly increasing,
and consequently her apparent size and brilliancy are as
rapidly decreasing, and she is soon altogether lost in the rays
of the sun and can only be seen by the aid of a telescope.</p>

<p>Venus makes a complete revolution round the sun in 224
days and 17 hours, but as the earth moves in the same direction
but at a slower rate the planet overtakes the earth in about
nineteen months, when we have her again as an evening and
morning star respectively as before, and so on continually.</p>

<p>And this is the Star of Bethlehem which has caused such
a stir within the past two months. All sorts of ridiculous
speculation and superstitious nonsense have been said concerning
it. Verily in this our day of rapid advancement
we are almost, if not quite, as ignorant of astronomical matters
as were the "wise men" of the East nearly two thousand
years ago, or the natives of Zululand of the present day.</p>

<p>I hope I have made this plain to you; or if there is anything
you do not understand, just ask the question and I will
endeavour to supply the information.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Bly</span>,&mdash;</p>


<p>I thought I would send a sketch of the eclipse Annie and
I stayed up to see. We had a very beautiful, clear night,
not a cloud to be seen. The moon entered its eastern edge
into the Penumbra at 8.29 and into the dark shadow at 9.30;
and at 11 p.m. the moon was in the centre of the shadow or
totally eclipsed, but we could still see it appearing like a
large orange and we could see all the principal craters and
mountains through the shadow, and I was very interested
to watch the stars disappear one after another behind the
edge of the moon. Of course I have not shown the sun in
the sketch because there is not room, but you must imagine
the sun to be about the size of a round table a good distance
away to the left of the earth.</p>

<p>Now I will try and explain to you what the Penumbra
is and how it is produced. It is produced simply because
the sun is so much larger than the earth, and you can make
a little experiment and show Freddy and William how it is
done. Place two lighted candles or lamps about the width
of this paper apart which will represent the sun, then a little
way off on a white cloth on the table place a teacup upside
down which will do very well to represent the earth, then you
will have the black shadow of the Penumbra or half shadow
on each side of it. A sixpence will represent the moon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
which you can slide gradually across the shadows, and you
will have the eclipse to a "t."</p>

<p>It is necessary to have two candles or lamps because the
sun is so much greater than the earth and the two candles'
light combined represents the sun's light. A small orange
perhaps would represent the earth as well or better than a
teacup, because the shadow of a cup would not run out to a
sharp point, but that of an orange would. That would not
matter much either way, only Freddy would most likely be
asking the question and you would not be able to answer him.</p>
